## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger that securely records and stores real-time digital asset transactions.

The core feature of a digital ledger is transparency and immutability. It’s practically impossible to corrupt, change or manipulate data because the blockchain creates a verified time stamp with multiple network nodes. Data incorruptibility is attractive to businesses across all industries, such as finance, healthcare, real estate, and banking.

Above all, companies want to hire top talent, and the demand for professional blockchain engineers,  [architects](https://cbrecruitment.com/blockchain-architect/)  and  [developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/)  is increasing.

In 2021, the blockchain market was $4.67 billion and this year (2022), the market stands at $7.18 billion, with a projected figure of $163.83 billion by 2029. Fortune Business Insights suggests that “_The open access to data facilitated by blockchain technologies will be the central growth determinant for this Industry.”_ (Source:  [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/06/2456388/0/en/With-56-3-CAGR-Blockchain-Market-To-Be-Worth-USD-163-83-Billion-by-2029.html)  website)

Blockchain engineers have options to progress to specialised fields such as project management, blockchain development, solution architecture, etc., and the salaries at these levels are significant.

Is it hard to become a blockchain engineer? If you’re starting from scratch, a significant amount of training is required, which can be overwhelming. However, if you’re fascinated by blockchain technology and happy to put in the work, the scope for a career as a blockchain engineer is vast.

## What does a blockchain engineer do?

Blockchain engineers have a highly responsible role. They must create high-level security solutions to protect digital assets. Senior blockchain engineers may be involved with a team of professionals such as [blockchain architect](https://cbrecruitment.com/blockchain-architect/)  and  [developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/), designing, developing and implementing blockchain solutions.

In addition, as blockchain technology develops exponentially, blockchain engineers must ensure they update their skills with evolving blockchain technology. It’s a career where you benefit from a passion for technology, where learning new skills is fun and not a chore.

## What skills do blockchain engineers need?

If you’re considering becoming a blockchain engineer, it might seem overwhelming how much there is to learn, such as extensive knowledge of data, coding languages, finance and more. The best thing to do is start with the required basic skills as a foundation for further learning.

### Blockchain engineer basic skills

Firstly, acquire foundational knowledge of blockchain technology and decentralisation. Learn how it works, the different aspects of developing and securing a blockchain and study the industry terminology.

Secondly, gaining foundational knowledge helps you absorb the more challenging aspects of training to become a blockchain engineer. There are several blockchain foundation courses available, which we’ll discuss later in the article.

### Blockchain architecture

Each blockchain has an explicit architecture, and a blockchain engineer needs to understand the architectural concepts. Study whitepapers on enterprise blockchain platforms to learn about hash functions, consensus mechanisms and more.

### Coding languages

You’ll need a high level of expertise in several coding languages, such as JavaScript, a standard programming language in most blockchain projects. Another popular language is Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. In addition, it’s helpful to become proficient in Python and Java languages.

### Extensive knowledge of cryptography

Cryptography qualifications and knowledge are essential for blockchain engineers because it’s at the heart of blockchain security. Hiring managers are more interested in candidates with cryptography skills because they need talent capable of encrypting decentralised records.

Two of the primary security algorithms in cryptography are hash functions and asymmetric key algorithms, so it will help your application to companies if you master these skills

### Basic knowledge of front-end and back-end web development

Whilst not essential skills, web development is part of a blockchain project, so understanding things such as user-experience design and API management help you to collaborate with your team.

### Understand the application of data structures

Learn about data structures used in blockchain because these skills contribute toward implementing a successful project.

### Working knowledge of blockchain platforms

There are three types of blockchain platforms: –

- Private
- Public
- Permissionless

A blockchain engineer must fully understand all three platforms to construct efficient solutions. As well as knowing how they work, it’s also necessary to understand the ecosystems of the platform. For instance, some of the largest industry ecosystems are  [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/),  [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/)  and  [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/), which all have unique application standards.

### Blockchain development tools

Successful enterprise blockchain engineers have extensive knowledge and mastery of multiple development tools such as MetaMask, Truffle and Remix.

From a hiring manager’s perspective, a candidate with multiple development tools can design solutions faster than an engineer with limited knowledge. Therefore, they’re more likely to hire candidates with more experience because speed and efficiency ensure a more cost-effective project.

### A foundational understanding of finance

Understanding decentralised finance and macroeconomics helps blockchain engineers create practical solutions for enterprises. To that end, gaining a finance certification can help you stand out among other candidates.

### Become a problem solver

Becoming a blockchain engineer requires more than the prerequisite hard skills. Above all, critical and strategic thinking skills are essential.

Hiring managers want solution-orientated candidates who can quickly and creatively problem-solve a project. If you’re unsure whether you’re a natural problem solver, ask yourself the following five questions: –

1. Do I focus on the problem or the solution when something goes wrong?
2. Can I concisely define a problem to another person?
3. Do I consider every angle and possibility of a solution?
4. Do I have an open-minded and flexible approach to problem-solving?
5. Can I clarify a problem and solution to transform it into clear targets?

Successful blockchain engineers are not fixed thinkers and do not focus on the problem unnecessarily. Instead, they immediately begin brainstorming solutions.

## Blockchain engineer salary

Salaries vary with experience. You can anticipate an entry-level salary of around £45,000. The salary for more senior blockchain engineers can be as high as £150,000. The median salary is £80,000.

## Blockchain engineer courses

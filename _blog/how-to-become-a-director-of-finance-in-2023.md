## What does a Director of Finance do?

Firstly, a finance director is a senior role. It may not be the sexiest job on the block, but a director of finance is responsible for an organisation’s entire finances, such as: –

- Financial development
- Managing cash flow
- Budgets
- Financial forecasting
- Financial reporting
- Mitigating risks

The finance director heads up the financial department, so leadership skills are necessary for this role. In addition, you’ll need the confidence to work with the C-suite, including the CEO, helping them navigate the business’s finances, making essential decisions and meeting financial KPIs.

## What Soft Skills does a Finance Director Need?

Above all, a finance director needs people skills and expert financial acumen.

**Personal (soft) Skills include: –**

- Excellent communication at all levels
- Positive attitude
- Proven track record of effective leadership
- Mentoring junior staff

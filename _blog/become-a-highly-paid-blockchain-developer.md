## What is a Blockchain Developer?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records and maintains details of every transaction on the entire global network.  If you’re searching for blockchain developer jobs, you may want to understand the role of a blockchain developer.

Firstly, a blockchain developer’s primary function is to design secure blockchain systems to enable the recording of transactions and keep data storage safe from hacking by preventing anyone from making changes. Secondly, a blockchain developer works with blockchain technologies, including developing application interfaces and features and maintaining server-side and client applications, such as smart contracts.

Blockchain developer roles require someone with highly-skilled knowledge and expertise in blockchain development programming languages and cryptography experience. In addition, companies want to hire a blockchain developer who can integrate tools and technologies and someone who can work fast and efficiently to design secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, in blockchain technology, transaction speed and efficiency are essential for providing scalable solutions.

## Blockchain Developer Job Specifications

Many companies require a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information Technology or equivalent, and be up to date with cryptology techniques. Above all, most companies require a minimum of two years of experience in blockchain development.

You should have advanced programming language experience, exceptional problem-solving skills, an analytical mind and a keen eye for details. In addition, you must be able to organise your workload without supervision, have good communication skills, and if you can collaborate well with a team, it will serve in your favour.

##### There are two types of Blockchain developers: –

1. **Blockchain Software Developer:**  Develops smart contracts, APIs and the front and back end of DApps
2. **Core Blockchain Developer:**  Designs the consensus and blockchain protocols, the network architecture and implements multiple blockchain functionality and features, etc.

In addition, you can work as a freelance blockchain developer or apply for a salaried position. There is a huge demand for top talent in  [cryptocurrency and blockchain jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/5-most-in-demand-cryptocurrency-jobs/).

## How to Become a highly-paid Blockchain Developer with no Experience

There’s a clear roadmap for beginning a career as a blockchain developer. This section provides a step-by-step guide for getting started in blockchain development.

### Academic Experience

A background in computer science is a great start or in-depth experience in Information technology. Most importantly, many blockchain developer roles specify a prerequisite for a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree. That is to say, you could experience challenges getting to the interview stage if a degree is a company requirement.

That said, not every company insists on a degree. For instance, you could get a foot in the door if you can demonstrate an academic background and aptitude for understanding and implementing blockchain technology. Training programs available for blockchain developers can help you gain valuable experience. In addition, certification enables demonstrable proof of knowledge to potential employers. That said, most of the leading IT companies insist on a degree.

### Develop your Tech Skills

Blockchain developer jobs require proficiency and expertise in multiple technical skills: –

- **Cryptography:**  an in-depth understanding of cryptographic concepts such as RSA algorithm, hash functions and digital signatures
- **Programming Languages:**  including programming concepts such as OOP concept (like Solidity) and languages such as Python, Java and C++
- **Databases and Networking:** an excellent working knowledge will help you to understand fundamental concepts for blockchain development
- **Data Structures:**  blockchain developers design efficient and unalterable systems, so an understanding of hashing, binary trees, linked lists, etc., is essential
- **Web Design and Development Understanding:**  back end knowledge of creating a website can help with the development process of DApps, etc.

### Foundational Understanding of Blockchain

There are many online courses and tutorials to help expand your knowledge of blockchain architecture and technology, such as distributed ledgers, consensus and hash functions. Moreover, knowledge of Bitcoin, decentralisation and public and private approaches may further assist your application for a blockchain developer job.

### Study Cryptonomics

Cryptonomics means cryptography and economics combined. Studying cryptonomics helps you to understand the methodology and economics behind cryptocurrencies. Likewise, you’ll learn about the mechanism behind transaction lifecycles and fees, mining and much more about how it relates to economics.

### Learn About Ethereum and DApps

Gain a background understanding of an open-source, decentralised blockchain network like Ethereum. Developers use Ethereum to securely and efficiently run smart protocols and develop DApps (distributed applications) and smart contracts.

There are alternative platforms to Ethereum, such as Hyperledger, but foundational knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain is certainly the preferred way to start.

### Learn about Smart Contracts & Solidity

“A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement” (Wikipedia).

In simple terms, a smart contract is a digital contract stored on a blockchain. It’s developed with predetermined and immutable functions that, when the terms and conditions are aligned, is automatically executed.

Smart contracts work on three components: –

1. Deterministic
2. Terminable
3. Isolation

Solidity is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language created by the Ethereum team. It’s used to build and develop smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain and other platforms to implement business logic to generate transaction record chains in the blockchain network.

### Get Hands-On Experience

Nothing beats hands-on experience in blockchain development. Putting the theory into real-world use and becoming familiar with the tools, platforms, and technology significantly increase your proficiency and value as a blockchain developer.

If you’re starting at entry-level, numerous training courses, internships and grants are available to enable access to all the resources you need. There are also many online communities where you can connect with experienced blockchain developers and gain invaluable insight into a career.

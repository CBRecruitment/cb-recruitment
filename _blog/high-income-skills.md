High income skills are essential to take your career to the next level. After acquiring the right skills to get an  [entry-level job in cryptocurrency](https://cbrecruitment.com/entry-level-cryptocurrency-jobs-with-no-experience/), the next step is to start building a portfolio of skills. Employees that commit to professional development are more likely to gain promotion and secure high income skills without degree requirements. The more value you bring to an organisation, the better salary you can command. After that, the sky’s the limit, and you could quickly find yourself in demand with a choice of high-paying employers.

Still, what are high income skills? Do you need to study technical subjects? In addition, the definition of a high income is subjective because it depends on your location and expenditure. For instance, if you live in London, the cost of living is higher than a home in a less populated area with fewer job opportunities.

If you are ready to increase your worth to an employer and want to discover the top 18 high income skills, this article is your most valuable resource.

## What Are High-Income Skills?

Firstly, let’s break down the definition of a high income. For many, the goal is a six-figure income, but for some, it means having extra money left over after paying the bills. According to a 2021 report by  [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416139/full-time-annual-salary-in-the-uk-by-region/), full-time London-based workers earned over £39.7k. In the North-East of England, the median salary was £27.5k, the lowest income bracket in the UK.

Only you can decide what is considered a high income. Our part is to help you discover what skills you can acquire to raise your annual salary.

The basic definition of “_skill_” is something you can do well, better than others in some cases. It doesn’t necessarily include a qualification, although if that’s possible, having something tangible to show potential employers is always beneficial.

High income skills can be either hard (technical) or soft (personality traits). Still, as you will see from the list of high income skills below, we focus predominantly on hard skills because these are usually the first competencies listed in most job descriptions. In addition, all jobs require soft skills like communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, leadership etc.

Before learning new hard skills, study what soft skills are needed to do the job. For example, if you train in  [UX design](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-ux-designer/), you must have the ability to work cohesively within a team.

Currently, candidates with specialised training in  [Web3](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/)  are in demand, such as  [blockchain developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/),  [architects](https://cbrecruitment.com/blockchain-architect/), and  [engineers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-blockchain-engineer/). Moreover, there is a shortage of qualified candidates and, as a result, organisations are happy to pay higher salaries to the right people.

## Do High Income Skills Help With a Job Search?

If you want to land a high-paying job, having high income skills can help your resume stand out among lesser-qualified applicants.  [Hiring managers](https://cbrecruitment.com/recruiter-vs-hiring-manager/)  employ the best candidates to add value to an organisation, so tailor your resume with your newly acquired skills and qualifications.

In  [Web3 jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/), there are often hundreds of applications for every open position. Therefore, when considering what career skills to develop, your question must be, “_why should an organisation hire me?_” and then gain the skills to make your application stand out from the rest.

When browsing the best high income skills list, focus on choosing the skills to suit the career you want to pursue.

## Preparing Your Resume for Job Applications

Many people list their qualifications on their  [resumes](https://cbrecruitment.com/resume-with-no-experience/)  and miss a vital point. Hundreds of applicants may have the same certifications, so how does a hiring manager determine who to call for an interview?

Firstly, focus on highlighting accomplishments using your skills. For example, if you’re in cybersecurity, detail an incident of when you prevented an attack. Be brief but feature the successful outcome of your contribution.

Using this method shows the hiring manager that you are a candidate who brings value to the table, not just another person with qualifications but no real-world experience. At this stage, grabbing attention is the aim. Prepare your resume to “_show, not tell_“.

Secondly, never send in the same resume to all job applications. Why not? Because that’s what most people do and then wonder why they never get an interview. Your resume must be tailored, relevant, and specific to each new application.

Study the job specification and select relevant keywords to add to your resume and cover letter. For example, if the job description has the following:

- Blockchain Engineer
- Blockchain projects
- Ethereum-based
- Team player
- Excellent communicator
- Problem-solver
- 2+ years of experience

Add these keywords to your resume at least twice and your cover letter. For instance, “_I am a blockchain engineer with 2+ years of experience working on Ethereum-based blockchain projects. I am a natural problem solver, a team player and an excellent communicator_.”

In behavioural economics, there is something called primacy bias, which means that we naturally focus on (and remember) the first parts of information given to us, so lead your resume and cover letter with your most memorable achievements. In addition, the same applies to interviews.

When asked about your strongest points, describe your best attribute, and use the least important to describe weaknesses. For example: –

- **Strength:**  “_I am determined and focused_“
- **Weakness:**  _“I can be impatient with myself, but I use it as fuel for completing a project, and it never crosses over in my team interactions.”_

You will gain extra brownie points if, during the interview, you can remember and use keywords from the job specification.

As more organisations focus on asking behavioural questions, learning the fundamentals of what they are looking for can help you stand out in an  [interview](https://cbrecruitment.com/job-interview-questions/). Stay relevant and relaxed. Hiring managers aren’t trying to trick you. They simply want the best person for the job.

## What To Do if You Don’t Have High-Income Skills

Most of the high income skills in the Web3 space are technical but don’t let that put you off. Depending on your training route, many technical skills are reasonably easy to learn.

### Professional Certification or Degree

Most organisations require applicants to have a degree if the job requires technical skills. If you can start a degree, computer science or IT can be an excellent direction to take, depending on your chosen career path. Not all employees demand candidates have a degree, so another alternative is professional certification. If you can then demonstrate real-world experience, there’s a good chance of getting an interview.

Many online certificated courses teach technical skills, often with flexible learning for self-study.  [Blockchain Council](https://www.blockchain-council.org/)  and  [101 Blockchains](https://101blockchains.com/)  have a good range of online certificated courses.

The primary downside to this alternative is maintaining the motivation to complete the training. Ideally, choose a course provider that provides a mentoring or coaching service and a peer community where you can find like-minded people and discuss ideas and progress.

When you have acquired sufficient skills, consider volunteering to gain real-use experience. If you add good value, it could lead to a job offer from the organisation.

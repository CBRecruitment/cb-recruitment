## Blockchain Developer

**Salary: £55,000 – £150,000+**

Blockchain developer is one of the most sought-after jobs in crypto. The work involves designing secure blockchain systems to keep data storage safe and record blockchain transactions.

Blockchain developers create immutable systems and develop application interfaces and features. In addition, a blockchain developer maintains server-side and client applications like smart contracts.

Blockchain developers fall into two distinct categories: –

1. **Core Blockchain Developers:**  Develop the network architecture, blockchain and consensus protocols and related blockchain security solutions
2. **Blockchain Software Developer:**  Develops APIs, smart contracts, and the front and blockchain-based back end of DApps

Blockchain developers need extensive blockchain technical skills, including smart contract development and programming languages like C++, Java or Solidarity. In addition, blockchain developers must understand cryptographic hash functions, consensus, data structures and distributed ledger technology.

Moreover, advanced knowledge of cryptography, such as SHA256 (Bitcoin) and KECCAK256 (Ethereum), are essential prerequisites if you want a position in blockchain development. In addition, you must have a grasp of asynchronous cryptography (a process using keys for encrypting and decrypting messages)

Blockchain architects lead blockchain projects combining business and software goals. They work closely with research and development teams to build and develop new performance standards and create innovative solutions. They’re project managers, strategists, team leaders and innovators.

Similarly to blockchain developers, a blockchain architect must understand the mechanisms of a blockchain system. That requires extensive coding skills and, in addition, well-developed technical, leadership and business skills.

The work is more demanding than a developer role; the knowledge base includes programming languages, data structures, blockchain interoperability and architecture, product specification and cryptography. In addition, a blockchain architect must understand front-end and back-end web design and development because you are responsible for coding concepts.

Blockchain architects must have the skill to implement strategy development and good communication skills to enable the team to implement assignments.

## Blockchain Project Manager

**Salary: £20,000 – £185,000**

Firstly, take note of the differentiation between each end of the salary scale. Primarily, salary depends on the company’s size, the project and your experience.

Secondly, blockchain project managers coordinate their time between clients and developers. They assess the project’s scope and work with a team for processing, database systems, and token economy. “_A token economy is a system of contingency management based on the systematic reinforcement of target behavior. The reinforcers are symbols or tokens that can be exchanged for other reinforcers”_  Wikipedia

The blockchain project manager works on the blockchain infrastructure if there is no token economy. The role includes overseeing transaction management systems, observing, reporting and working on security protocols. Above all, the objective of a blockchain project manager is to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability. You’ll need to immerse yourself in the development lifecycle of the projects and prioritise risk management.

Finally, a blockchain project manager must be an excellent communicator, a good team leader and manager and have strategic thinking skills.

## Blockchain UX Designer

**Salary: £65,000 – £117,000**

We enjoy visuals, hence the popularity of the colourful, often garish, NFTs. As blockchain technology gained popularity, projects sought to create more visually appealing user-interfaces (UI) to make them more accessible and beginner-friendly to crypto enthusiasts.

The role of a blockchain UX designer is to turn complicated technology like smart contracts into an easy-to-understand visual. UX means “user experience.” The front-end and back-end user experience is often complex and challenging for many blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. Therefore, UX designers create visual, easy-to-follow UX cues for users.

Blockchain UX designers usually work autonomously. There are no fixed rules for creating the best user interface. In other words, the objective is to create something visually attractive and intuitive for beginners.

Blockchain UX designers need UX/UI design implementation skills and working knowledge of mockup and wireframe design tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch or Figma. In addition, it can help to increase the scope of your work if you are familiar with HTML, JavaScript or CSS.

If you enjoy having the freedom to be creative, a Blockchain UX Designer role could be perfect for you.

**Salary: £45,000 – £135,000**

Blockchain engineers build and implement digital blockchain solutions for companies. They’ll do an in-depth analysis of current solutions, including the infrastructure, and have a discovery meeting with the client to understand the company objectives and goals. The engineer then works to develop assets or accelerators, building the infrastructure in line with requirements. Subsequently, they may have to create documents for the infrastructure and safeguard back-end functionality.

Blockchain engineers often use Hyperledger or Ethereum platforms to make their job more effective. In addition, they may also be responsible for training inexperienced employees.

Like most blockchain jobs, Blockchain engineers must demonstrate an extensive understanding of blockchain architecture, front-end and back-end development, data structures and cryptography. In addition, acquiring in-depth working knowledge of one or more programming languages like Solidarity, C++ or Python can add to your value to a company.

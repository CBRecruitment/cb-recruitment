## What sort of companies hire for crypto jobs?

You could be applying for blockchain jobs, working for a decentralised platform or a centralised, traditional, non-crypto company. Certainly, today, many established, well-known companies are increasingly hiring crypto developers to capitalise on the expanding power of blockchain-based technology.

For instance, PayPal began expanding into cryptocurrency in 2021, allowing some users to checkout with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). PayPal also owns the  [Venmo mobile payment app](https://venmo.com/), which now promotes cryptocurrency payments. In addition, publicly owned companies such as Microsoft and IBM are helping companies in various sectors to integrate blockchain into existing processes.

## How easy is it to get a crypto job without experience?

Without relevant experience, you may struggle to find an entry-level cryptocurrency job. Cryptocurrency is more of an evolving community than a particular industry. For instance, you could land an entry-level position in crypto with a mainstream bank. Moreover, what that means is it isn’t necessary to target your job efforts purely with cryptocurrency platforms like a crypto exchange, for instance.

Depending on what direction you choose to pursue entry-level cryptocurrency jobs, many companies have prerequisites for employment. For instance, if you want to learn how to  [become a highly-paid blockchain developer](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/), most employers require a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science or Information Technology. In addition, a good grasp of programming languages like Java, C++, Python or Solidity can help you get ahead of competing candidates.

## What do employers want when they’re hiring for entry level cryptocurrency jobs?

Above all, most jobs in cryptocurrency need to see you have crypto enthusiasm, some experience and a broad scope of understanding of the crypto space.

You might expect an interviewer to ask questions about your crypto certifications and skills, but they are just as likely to enquire about what you have “_done_” with cryptocurrencies.

For instance, have you traded cryptocurrencies or started a crypto portfolio? If so, what happened? What did you learn? Have you explored yield farming, bought, created and sold NFTs or qualified for airdrops? Perhaps you have written and published cryptocurrency, blockchain or NFT articles.

Interviewers may ask what  [DeFi](https://cbrecruitment.com/defi-jobs/)  projects or NFT collections you like or enquire about your success with optimising DeFi yields.

Why do interviewers want to know these details? Because it shows your level of immersion in the  [Web3 space](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/). Above all, wanting an entry-level cryptocurrency job only because you can earn a decent salary is not enough for a company to consider hiring you. Moreover, the crypto-passionate newbie may surpass a less enthusiastic candidate with more certifications and skills. Not always, but it’s worth considering your motives for wanting a crypto job.

Not all crypto jobs require technical “_know-how_“, but it would help if you understand the fundamentals of NFTs, cryptos and blockchain technology before applying for a cryptocurrency role. Subsequently, an enthusiastic and curious approach to continual professional development can also be valuable for candidates seeking a cryptocurrency career.

### Build an on-chain resume for entry-level cryptocurrency jobs

Building an on-chain resume is an excellent route for helping a recruiter learn about your experience in the crypto space. What is an on-chain resume? It’s a verifiable blockchain record of your crypto activities. Today, most candidates mainly submit a paper version of their CV in PDF or Word format. Recruiters or employers may check the candidate’s details, but many do not. Unfortunately, some candidates are not averse to bending the truth.

An on-chain resume removes the possibility of distorting data. Some platforms document your on-chain activities, such as  [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/), a company that curates your on-chain requests, such as swapping and lending on  [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/).

“_Gain the skills you’ll need in the web3 economy. Earn on-chain credentials that demonstrate your mastery of core skills and protocols_.” – RabbitHole website.

Image from  [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/)

If you aren’t already doing this, get started now on RabbitHole. You can learn how to use and contribute to decentralised apps and earn experience points and token rewards based on your on-chain activity.

In addition, get the  [Degenscore](https://degenscore.com/)  (Degen) app for reporting on your overall on-chain performance. Degen measures how much your wallet interacts with DeFi smart contracts and protocols, giving you a score. Recently, some job requirements have made specific references to the Degan app.

Remember, building a verifiable on-chain resume might be something your competitors aren’t doing, which means you stand more chance of attracting positive attention from potential employers.

### Find your cryptocurrency niche

Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts find themselves drawn to one area of interest. You may be a Bitcoin fanatic, an Ethereum lover, or an avid follower of NFT trends. Perhaps you’re an online gamer fascinated with the play-to-earn economics and technology behind blockchain games and virtual realities. You might want to become a  [video game designer](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-video-game-designer/). If you have writing skills and a creative mindset, there are opportunities to creat an exciting care as a [video game writer](https://cbrecruitment.com/video-game-writer/).

You may prefer sharing the community goals of a DAO and enjoy engaging with Discord projects, opinions and conversations.

Finding  [cryptocurrency jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/5-most-in-demand-cryptocurrency-jobs/)  in your niche increases the chances of success. For instance, if you love everything Ethereum, applying for Bitcoin jobs is unlikely to be fruitful or rewarding. You probably understand the technology underpinning the Ethereum network, so why not focus on that instead of trying to learn other protocols from scratch that you have less interest in learning.

Focusing on the highest-paid blockchain jobs may be secondary to applying to entry level cryptocurrency jobs that present the most interest to you. For job satisfaction, the latter potentially offers more scope for career progression because you’ll commit to your daily tasks with energy and enthusiasm.

### Turn your DAO contribution into a crypto job

DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations) often hire regular contributors who have helped promote or build a project. The key is to get noticed, be visible, attend community calls and remain active on the project’s Discord servers. Show the DAO that you are a person who gets things done proficiently.

Some contributors publish relevant and authoritative articles on content platforms that help encourage mainstream adoption or support of the project. By adding SEO keywords and adhering to SEO principles, getting your post on page one of Google is an excellent way to get noticed by the DAO.

## What are the best courses to learn about entry-level cryptocurrency remote jobs?

Companies hiring for crypto jobs expect candidates to have certification to prove the demonstrable skills and knowledge required for a position. Still, if you don’t have the time, funding or inclination to study for a degree, there are other avenues for certificated training.

Finding relevant training for crypto careers is not difficult. Several Ivy League schools like Cambridge, Stanford and Princeton now offer blockchain and cryptocurrency courses, and universities and colleges have added the subjects to their curriculum.

There are many free and paid online self-study courses to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain. Further, if you are a complete beginner, start with a broad training that familiarises you with cryptocurrency terminology and technology

## Conclusion: Discover exciting entry-level cryptocurrency jobs with no experience

This guide looked at several ways to prepare for finding entry level cryptocurrency jobs. It may be possible to start working in a crypto role or apply for blockchain jobs without a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant subject. Still, even though you’re starting at entry-level, if you want the best career in cryptocurrency, setting higher standards of education will reap the rewards in the future.

Above all, think about what stands out on your resume. For instance, are you highlighting irrelevant job roles or featuring your experience with cryptocurrency, NFTs and blockchain? In addition, try not to get stuck thinking you don’t have enough experience because some companies would take on an active crypto enthusiast interested in learning and improving their skills.

Consider committing to an on-chain resume and building proof of your cryptocurrency activities, and decide on your preferred niche. There are many Bitcoin jobs available for entry-level candidates.

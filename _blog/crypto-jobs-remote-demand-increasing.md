## Do governments take cryptocurrencies seriously?

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden agrees that cryptocurrencies can no longer be considered a fad. To clarify, in March 2022, President Biden signed an executive order directing government agencies to collaborate on setting up a regulatory framework for digital currencies.

The move was certainly welcomed by cryptocurrency experts such as Cleve Mesidor, the public policy advisor at the Blockchain Association. Mesidor said,  _“It’s a step in the right direction that the White House is assessing digital assets from the perspective of innovation and competitiveness. Data shows working, and middle-class Americans that have been locked out of the traditional financial system are leading mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.”_

Still, what does this order mean for the future of cryptocurrency jobs? This guide outlines the top reasons why you might want to work in cryptocurrency and how to get started.

Firstly, you may know that the cryptocurrency market hasn’t performed well during 2022. The price of Bitcoin and altcoins crashed to new lows, and many uneducated investors are saying that’s it, cryptocurrency is over, and the bubble has burst.

Nothing could be further from the truth for jobs in the cryptocurrency industry.

Regardless of market conditions for Bitcoin and falling cryptocurrency prices, the demand for skilled candidates for crypto and blockchain jobs is increasing. Cryptocurrency firms and publicly owned companies are searching for the top talent in the crypto space, and compensation packages are significant for the right candidate.

## What’s it like to work in the crypto industry?

You might imagine that all crypto remote jobs involve working for one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase or Gate.io. These companies often promote remote crypto jobs and offer an attractive benefits package. The demand in  [Web3 jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/)  is surpassing expectations and that is unlikely to slow down soon.

Some of these crypto exchanges offer employee equity and stock options. Coinbase, for instance, was recently listed on NASDAQ. The stock profits could add to your income package if the stock performs well.

## Is it safe to work in cryptocurrency?

As mentioned earlier, the demand for talent in cryptocurrency is currently exceeding the supply. There is no correlation between the volatile cryptocurrency market and  [cryptocurrency jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/5-most-in-demand-cryptocurrency-jobs/). Companies across the globe are adopting blockchain technology to improve existing processes, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

## Do I get paid in cryptocurrency?

How about if the company pays employees with cryptocurrency? Is that safe, considering the unpredictability of cryptocurrency prices?

Good question.

If you accept your salary paid in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, these are the factors to consider. Suppose you receive £5000 in Ethereum (ETH) at the end of the month, and the next week, the price of $ETH drops by 50%? Yes, in that case, you are out of pocket. In addition, another factor to consider is you pay tax on the exact payment amount, not on the value later.

However, you can negotiate payment with a stablecoin, such as $USDC, which is pegged to the U.S dollar. That means if the dollar value is $0.90, the $USDC price correlates with it. The leading cryptocurrency exchanges list $USDC. You can exchange it for fiat currency on an off-ramp cryptocurrency platform.

If you’re working for a cryptocurrency company like an exchange, discuss your concerns and agree on how best you prefer to be paid.

## Is it better to join a cryptocurrency start-up company?

It’s an ongoing debate whether it is better to work in a crypto job for an established, publicly owned company or take a calculated risk on working a remote crypto job with a fresh, new start-up company. The honest answer is there are no guarantees for job security in either situation. For instance, Coinbase is a long-standing cryptocurrency exchange with a superb reputation in the crypto industry. Still, recently Coinbase had to “_lay off_” over 1,000 staff.

Whatever company you choose to work for, it’s a good idea to ensure the company’s mission, values, and culture align with yours. Entrepreneurial risk-takers typically lead start-up companies. Blockchain developer jobs and  [Web3 jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/)  are in-demand for start-up companies. Some employees and contractors enjoy the potential for massive growth by working with some of the brightest minds in blockchain technology, the  [metaverse](https://cbrecruitment.com/metaverse-jobs/),  [NFTs](https://cbrecruitment.com/best-5-nft-jobs/),  [Fintech](https://cbrecruitment.com/fintech-jobs-2022/)  or  [DeFi](https://cbrecruitment.com/defi-jobs/).

### Why do venture capitalists back start-ups

[Venture capitalists](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-venture-capitalist/)  often back crypto start-ups because they know the tech industry presents high potential growth. Investors can get involved at ground level and potentially see a significant return on the investment.

Crypto start-ups these days are not lawless cowboys pushing a Ponzi scheme into the market. Indeed, cryptocurrency attracts some of the greatest minds in tech, innovators who want to make a global impact, disrupt mainframe processes, and change the world. They’re motivated by a higher purpose to lead the way and encourage mainstream adoption of the expanding world of blockchain technology.

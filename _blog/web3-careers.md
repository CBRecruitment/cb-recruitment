## Is Web3 Ready to Go?

Web3 is still uncharted territory. It’s an umbrella description (_coined by Ethereum founder and Polkadot creator Gavin Wood_) encompassing blockchain technologies, the metaverse, NFTs, virtual reality, token-based economies and more.

Web3 is not only liberating users. It is transforming almost every aspect of what we know about the Internet and its uses. Finally, Web3 allows content creators to claw back ownership without relying on centralised BigTech entities controlling their actions and content.

Web3 ecosystems are still emerging, and most are built on Web2 infrastructure—for example, Discord, GitHub and Twitter. This situation will change, but creating the necessarily robust and high-quality Web3 infrastructure will take time. The demand for candidates to assist in Web3 development is extraordinary, though unsurprisingly, high.

Web3 job opportunties: Exciting careers for 2023

## How is Web3 Better than Web2?

Web3 solutions arose from the concern that Web2 Internet users had no choice but to put their trust in centralised organisations, relying on these entities to act in their best interest. As you undoubtedly know, it’s not unusual to hear about the closure of influencer media accounts, with the account holder potentially losing years of hard work and their army of followers.

The core premise of Web3 is that it is decentralised, censorship-resistant, trustless and permissionless, which means that everyone worldwide (including developers and Internet users) can access direct ownership without exclusion.

Web3 uses cryptocurrency for native payments, relinquishing the reliance on outdated centralised infrastructures such as payment processors and banks. Instead of relying on these third-party entities (not to change the rules), Web3 uses economic mechanisms and user incentives.

On Web3, users store their data on the blockchain. If a user leaves the platform, they can take their data with them to plug into a new decentralised interface. With Web2, imagine trying to move hundreds of thousands of followers from a channel such as YouTube, LinkedIn or Facebook. It’s a mammoth task, impossible because you do not own your content or followers.

Likewise, in video games, in-game purchases are connected to your account in Web2. A game creator can legally delete your account anytime, and, as a result, you lose everything you accrued. This scenario cannot happen in Web3 because you have direct ownership via NFTs (non-fungible tokens). In-game items can be sold, traded or moved if you stop playing.

## Top 10 Best Web3 Job Opportunities

The following is by no means a definitive list of Web3 job opportunities. Indeed, it’s a long list with something for everyone interested in starting a Web3 career. However, these are typical Web3 jobs we regularly see as a specialist crypto recruitment company.

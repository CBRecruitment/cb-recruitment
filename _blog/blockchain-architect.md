## What is a blockchain architect?

A blockchain architect (sometimes called a blockchain solutions architect) works with research and development teams to create the best architecture to suit a blockchain system.

The job involves leading blockchain projects to design, build and develop performance standards and create innovative and effective solutions across blockchain architecture frameworks.

Blockchain architects have a significant understanding of blockchain systems. Their extensive knowledge enables them to create a roadmap for engineers, developers, and the team. In addition, they are innovators, strategists, project managers and team leaders but also require interpersonal and business skills, coding, and technical proficiency.

## What skills do blockchain architects need?

The role of a blockchain architect is multi-faceted and demanding. Anyone can acquire the necessary technical skills but the combination of prerequisite hard and soft skills makes it a challenge for companies to find top talent for blockchain architecture solutions.

### Top 10 skills required for blockchain architects

1. **Blockchain fundamentals:** Must have an extensive understanding of blockchain foundations, interoperability and architecture. In addition, knowledge of data structures, smart contracts, consensus algorithms and distributed ledger technologies
2. **Blockchain frameworks:** Extensive knowledge of frameworks such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, R3 Corda, and Fabric
3. **Programming languages:**  For example, Java, C++, Python, NodeJS and Solidity
4. **Cryptography:** Must have extensive knowledge of cryptography as it’s fundamental to blockchain security
5. **Front end and back end web design and development:**  The role includes responsibility for coding concepts, so this knowledge helps an architect to create a good project roadmap
6. **Risk and failure analysis:** For the function of preparing for and reducing risk
7. **Performance indicators:**  Ability to assess ongoing performance of the blockchain
8. **Consensus algorithms:** For example, good command of Ethereum and Bitcoin consensus algorithms
9. **Leadership and Management:**  The architect is responsible for leading and managing a team of professionals, and experts in their own right, such as  [blockchain developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/)  and  [engineers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-blockchain-engineer/). You must be able to train and identify team strengths and weaknesses to develop a practical and effective blockchain solution that benefits the business
10. **Business experience:**  Understanding business models is crucial for a blockchain solutions architect. For example, working within a budget and implementing potential revenue models

In addition to the above skills, a blockchain solutions architect needs product specification experience. You’re working with client requirements, so the blockchain solution is a balance of meeting client demands and factoring in consumer understanding of the product. Therefore, you must clearly define product specifications for the client, your team and the end user. In addition, you must be an excellent strategist and innovative problem solver, navigating issues quickly as they arise.

## Blockchain architect’s salary

The role of an experienced blockchain solutions architect is challenging and demanding. You’re responsible for multiple aspects of creating a blockchain solution, including training and managing a team. Therefore, a certified blockchain architect can anticipate a salary of £150,000 to £185,000+.

## The best blockchain architect certification training

You’re ready to become a certified blockchain architect, so where do you begin? How easy is it to train for a lucrative career, and how long does it take?

Firstly, the question to ask yourself is if you have the aptitude and enthusiasm to learn the multiple technical aspects of the role. It could be challenging if you cannot grasp technical subjects.

Secondly, do you have excellent interpersonal skills? If not, the role may not be suitable for you. It’s a people-driven role, leading and managing a team, working with clients and navigating the numerous issues that arise when people work together. While most people can learn hard skills such as programming languages, developing soft skills is difficult. As it’s a crucial aspect of succeeding in the role, consider if your soft skills are sufficiently well-developed.

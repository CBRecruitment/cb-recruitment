## What Does a Blockchain Consultant do?

Blockchain consulting services include advising an organisation to plan, develop and implement blockchain strategies to improve business efficiency. Firstly, a blockchain consultant analyses the potential effect of blockchain on the organisation. Secondly, they identify and discuss potential roadblocks and solutions with business owners, shareholders, or managers.

A blockchain consultant (sometimes called a crypto consultant) requires a combination of hands-on technical skills and an innovative, creative mindset. Principally, a consultant must understand blockchain tasks and processes, such as prebuilt solutions and cloud integration.

The primary role of blockchain consulting services is to create a POC (proof of concept) that demonstrates that the blockchain has real-world applications for the organisation. In addition, the consultant must identify potential risk factors and create a risk management plan.

Suppose you’re planning to become a blockchain consultant. In that case, you must also have a handle on providing legal advice and helping a company understand and manage blockchain technology’s financial aspects.

## Fundamental Blockchain Consulting Skills

Increasingly, organisations are learning about the multiple benefits of blockchain technology, such as decentralisation, cost savings, efficiency, transparency, and enhanced security. Above all, many companies would like to adopt blockchain in their business models but have no idea where to begin. Subsequently, hiring the services of a blockchain consultant can help a company translate its interest in blockchain into reality.

Many blockchain consultants begin their careers by gaining a BSc in Computer Science. Primarily, it provides a good grounding in overall knowledge, especially if the degree features specific blockchain modules.

Above all, the fundamental skills required to launch blockchain consultant services are: –

- Software development
- Technology
- Programming
- Analysis skills
- Innovative mindset
- Adaptable and able to follow emerging blockchain trends and technology
- A good grasp of the implications of financial and legal aspects of blockchain

### Blockchain Consulting Salary

The average salary for a blockchain consultant is £43,000 to £78,000. However, these figures may be higher for freelance blockchain consulting services. The more experience you have as a blockchain consultant, the higher salary you can expect. In addition, some high-end industries have a bigger budget for blockchain consultants, and you may also choose a specialism within your blockchain consulting services.

### Attractive Employee Benefits

Not only is blockchain consulting well-paid. You can also expect excellent benefits such as bonuses and extra vacation days. If you have real-world, market-level blockchain experience, organisations value your services highly. As a result, you could find your career and social status rising to new heights.

## What are a Blockchain Consultant’s Job Responsibilities?

Your role as a blockchain consultant will vary for different companies, but some of the job responsibilities might include implementing the following strategies: –

1. **Impact analysis:**  Typically, you will identify if adopting blockchain will disrupt business processes and if so, provide a set of solutions to minimise disruption.
2. **Business tactics:**  Create strategies to mitigate business disruption and assess if the company is prepared to manage the situation. If not, discuss potential business solutions.
3. **Develop roadmaps for the future:**  Outline a clear and workable roadmap for at least 1-2 years that the organisation can follow.
4. **Host consulting workshops:**  Your work as a blockchain consultant may include lectures to enterprise professionals.
5. **Assess financial costs:**  If the enterprise has a budget, the blockchain consultant must calculate what is possible within budget. Alternatively, the blockchain consultant assesses the total costs of implementing the blockchain project. After that, the next step is to find ways to cut costs without losing the integrity of the solution.
6. **Keeping stakeholders happy:**  Working with stakeholders can be tricky. They may have fixed thinking about blockchain solutions and are uncomfortable with the costs and disruption of implementing changes. The expert blockchain consultant must have the skills to navigate the potential obstacles stakeholders present.  
    In addition, once the stakeholders are aligned with the idea, pitching the technical aspects of the solution requires the superpower of translating complex subjects into understandable, jargon-free explanations.
7. **Identifying the organisation’s Use Cases:**  Every organisation is unique, so there isn’t a one-stop solution for use cases. Blockchain consultants identify clients’ needs and present the organisation’s best scalable blockchain solution use cases.
8. **Provide technical backup:**  Depending on the consultant’s expertise, they must individually provide technical backup such as architectures, implementing frameworks (such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, Quorum), APIs etc. or work with a team to provide the necessary support.

Moreover, in some cases, it may be necessary to refer to and adapt the organisation’s reference architecture. Most clients require blockchain consultants to submit proof of concept (POC) to inspire confidence before they consider implementing changes.

**Other essential factors blockchain consultants must consider: –**

- Data privacy
- Risk management analysis: If risk management isn’t part of your skillset, it may require outsourcing to third-party resources
- Data security & Data standards: Implement layers of security to blockchain solutions using common data standards
- Regulatory compliance
- Building digital trust
- Disaster recovery: Be prepared to deal with a disaster. The best blockchain consultants are excellent problem solvers and maintain calm amid challenges
- Adapting and modifying as a business grows: Business perspectives inevitably change over time, so be prepared to implement adaptations to prevent a solution from becoming obsolete.  
    In addition, some business processes are not compatible with blockchain, which means modifying to make a process operational
- Cloud interface management: Cloud security is typically weak
- Legacy systems: Only tackle the crucial task of integrating legacy systems with blockchain if you are technically skilled

## Conclusion: Is Blockchain Consulting the Best Career for 2023?

A career in blockchain consulting may seem like the ideal move for 2023. If you plan to become a blockchain consultant, be aware of many people offering blockchain consulting services without the right to do so.

Anyone can set up a business in blockchain consulting, claiming to be the best at their job. However, few people are qualified to conduct high quality work. They set up a business as a blockchain advisor without the depth of technical skills to best take care of their clients.

The most important task is to gain the technical skills and experience to manage every aspect of providing a consultancy service for enterprise blockchain solutions. Subscribe to training or earn a degree to show employers or clients that you have real-life experience.

Is job hopping bad? You would think so, but according to a  [Gallop poll](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx), 60% of millennials (born between 1980 – 1996) are the generation more predisposed to job hopping for a better position. Indeed, the report states that 21% of millennials changed jobs during the last year, and they’re also the least engaged generation in the workplace.

Understandably, people are changing jobs while buying a house in a new location, and other reasons. Still, job hopping employees costs the US economy $30.5 billion annually. Unfortunately, low  [engagement and retention rates](https://cbrecruitment.com/employee-retention-strategies/)  are costly to organisations, and “_checked-out”_  employees can disrupt the workplace.

The demand for skilled candidates in Web3 may have created more opportunities for all ages, but no employer wants to hire an individual they suspect may leave the company within a year. Does this mean hiring candidates from an older generation, or are there any benefits to job hopping from an employer’s perspective?

This article will discuss the reasons and benefits of job hopping and how it could be a bonus for a business.

## What is Job Hopping?

Job hopping refers to an individual who changes jobs voluntarily and frequently. Job hoppers (sometimes called job jumpers) typically search for a company with more to offer than their current position. They want to climb up the career ladder, which could include seeking higher salaries or bonuses, more promotional opportunities, better workplace conditions, culture or leadership, more challenges, or responsibilities. Of course, people may feel unappreciated by their current employer.

The days where workers stayed with a company for thirty or forty years to retirement are declining, if almost non-existent. The new generations want more from their work. Life/work balance may be necessary to some professional’s job hopping to find an exciting career working remotely.

Switching jobs frequently is often a career choice, but it’s not all bad. Ryan Kahn of the Hired Group, HR specialists, says, “_the perception of job hopping has changed in recent times and is now becoming normal for many_“.

## Should I Change Jobs or Stay Where I Am?

Young skilled, ambitious professionals with digital profiles are in high demand and most likely to change jobs. They may be headhunted or habitually spend time searching for better opportunities. If you are considering job hopping, ask yourself a few essential questions: –

1. What is the core reason for job hopping?
2. What are the pros and cons of leaving your company?
3. Have you genuinely made the most of your current job?
4. Have you talked to your current employer about how you feel?
5. Would you still want to leave if your current employer matched the new company’s offer?
6. What do you want long-term from your career?

Most people want a worthwhile job that gives them a sense of purpose. Working for the same employer for a long time has pros and cons. For instance, employers may think long-term employees (in the same role) are unambitious and unwilling to take on more challenges.

If you job hop, you may miss out on the opportunity for your employer to appreciate and express your value through promotions, higher salary, remote working etc. Job hopping also gets a bad rap as you cannot prove loyalty to a potential new employer.

## Are you Becoming a Job Hopper?

Job hopping is more prevalent for young professionals, especially in technology fields. Many workers choose  [Web3 careers](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-careers/)  where they can work on individual projects, enjoying using their skills to build something new in the space.

If you approach a new job with your eye on the next shiny company or project, you are probably becoming a job hopper.

A poll by Randstad, one of the largest HR companies globally, showed that job hopping might be part of the great resignation as  [69% of UK workers](https://www.randstad.co.uk/about-us/industry-insight/great-resignation/)  are ready to move jobs. Tech, logistics and construction workers were most confident about job hopping, and 24% of UK employees said they planned to change jobs in the next 3 – 6 months.

For companies that aren’t against candidates who have moved jobs several times, let’s discover what they consider the top attributes of hiring a job hopping employee.

## Top 3 Attributes of a Job Hopper

Is job hopping bad?

### #1 Passion for learning

Job hoppers are continuous learners. They want to gain knowledge and skills to take on new challenges, earn a higher salary and get more job satisfaction. In Web3 technology, candidates with the drive to learn and do better are in demand. As technology evolves quickly, organisations need employees who keep track of emerging trends and technological advances.

### #2 High functioning and adaptable

Changing jobs can be stressful, but resilient job hoppers thrive on new challenges. They are confident individuals who can cope with stress and enjoy change.

The human brain is evolutionarily wired for survival. Subsequently, we create habitual thinking patterns, which become hardwired as neural pathways in the brain, making it harder for us to break habits.

Your brain makes new neural pathways every moment of the day. In the study of neuroplasticity, neuroscientists prove that if we can create a new positive habit, we can change our behaviour.

Job hopping individuals consistently place themselves “_out of their comfort zone_“, making them more likely to adapt to change, have higher levels of functioning and subsequently be more resistant to stress.

### #3 Job hoppers know what they want

Though it’s not always the case, as job hopping can become an addictive behaviour pattern, overall, job hoppers have a clear “_end goal_” for their career. They are driven by ambitious goals and do what is needed to achieve them. As they continually push their limits in new positions, job hoppers may develop an awareness of strengths and weaknesses and strive to improve.

Working with a wide range of people often leads to enhanced communication skills and emotional intelligence. Without these two qualities, job hoppers eventually become unemployable because they cannot work collaboratively with a team. Therefore, it’s in their interest to develop these invaluable skills.

Ask yourself “Should I change jobs?”

## Top 5 Disadvantages of Hiring a Job Hopper?

Most organisations want to improve engagement and retention rates because a high staff turnover can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive. Therefore, research whether the company focuses on  [improving staff retention](https://cbrecruitment.com/employee-retention-strategies/)  before jumping to the next job. You are unlikely to get an interview or a job if they are.

**Employees may consider the following aspects: –**

1. Lack of commitment and consistency
2. No specialisation skills
3. Failure to have a long-term vision
4. Concern that the individual will not fully commit to a project
5. Disruption in the workplace: High staff turnover can reduce employee confidence

## Top 7 Advantages of Hiring a Job-Hopping Individual

Generally, job hoppers have specialist skills. In Web3, the  [demand for tech talent](https://cbrecruitment.com/crypto-jobs-remote-demand-increasing/)  is high, and candidates with the prerequisite soft and hard skills can bring a lot to project development.

1. Finding this type of talent is easier (as they are actively looking for a specific job with a company)
2. They are ambitious and want to develop the best skills possible so they can climb the career ladder
3. Job hoppers can be more motivated and productive because they have actively chosen the role
4. They often have excellent communication skills, which makes them good team leaders
5. They may have more experience in a variety of fields and more familiarity with different business models, products, brands, and processes
6. They are adaptable and flexible thinkers (individuals with rigid thinking patterns rarely do well in any workplace)
7. They may have a thriving network of professional contacts

## Conclusion: Can Job Hopping Jettison Your Career in 2023?

You don’t have to  [hate your job](https://cbrecruitment.com/i-hate-my-job/)  to want to move. Regularly changing jobs can accelerate your career prospects and allow you to explore the Web3 job market. However, job hopping takes careful consideration and planning because many organisations consider it unfavourably.

The opposite applies to freelance contractors, as they often work under contract. Web3 workers, such as cybersecurity specialists, often work on short-term contracts for three to six months. They are in demand, often headhunted and paid a great deal for their services by top-tier organisations.

As an employee, job hopping in the permanent job market can be tricky and not without considerable risks.

If you notice you’re getting into the habit of job hopping, focus on developing specialist skills and upgrading your soft skills, such as emotional intelligence, leadership, problem-solving, conceptual thinking, negotiation, communication and similar.

When approaching a company, make sure you can explain your job-hopping career in a way that sells your value to the company. There are multiple  [reasons for leaving a job](https://cbrecruitment.com/reason-for-job-change-in-interviews/), but correctly framing your responses is essential. Bad-mouthing your past employer or team manager is not the way to do it.

If you have developed a tech specialism and enjoy job hopping from project to project, it may be better if you consider becoming a contractor. Working short-term contracts addresses the need for frequent change. In addition, you can build a broad network of contacts and professionals in your field. Top contractors in Web3 can have their pick of jobs.

Contact the  [CB Recruitment Specialists](https://cbrecruitment.com/contact/)  to discuss your options if you’re looking for your next role in Web3, whether it’s an  [entry-level cryptocurrency role](https://cbrecruitment.com/entry-level-cryptocurrency-jobs-with-no-experience/)  or a C-Suite position.

In every interview, hiring managers almost always ask,  _“what are you looking for in your next role?”_ Your answer could mean the difference between getting a job offer or not.

If your first interview is a phone call, read  [20 phone interview tips that will get you a second intervie](https://cbrecruitment.com/phone-interview-tips/)w.

Undoubtedly, your answer is individual to you, certain things are best not said if you want to secure a job position. Above all, in this post, we’ll explore the pros and cons of how to respond positively and help you stand out from other candidates.

Firstly, what are you looking for in your next job? Before attending a phone interview or a face-to-face meeting with a hiring manager, it’s helpful to be 100% clear so that you can easily describe what you are looking for in your next job.

Secondly, the trick is to know what you want from a new position combined with what the company is looking for. For example, answering  _“I want to work remotely three days a week and have free coffee for the rest of my life”_  isn’t going to work if the job description states that the new position is 100% office based (and no free coffee).

Yes, it may seem obvious, but you might be surprised how often candidates mess up their answers and blow the chance of getting a great job offer. Moreover, hiring managers often ask about the reason for job change in interviews.

## What Does the Hiring Manager Really Want to Know?

When a hiring manager asks, “_what are you looking for in this job_?” they want to know if you are the right person for the role. A hiring manager’s job might seem like a cushy number, but interviewing dozens of people and trying to filter the BS from the genuine candidates is no easy task.

Above all, hiring managers have an important job to do. Undoubtedly, they need to hire the best candidate as efficiently as possible and determine if the person they employ is likely to: –

- Fit in with the company and culture
- Do a great job: Be up and running ASAP
- Can work without constant supervision
- Add value to an existing team or project
- Not jump ship a few months down the line
- Be adaptable to change
- Retain the enthusiastic attitude noted in the interview
- Become an overall valuable contributor to the workforce

Above all, how you respond to the question tells the hiring manager if your goals, skills, and interests align with the organisation. If your answer misaligns, don’t expect a second interview or a job offer.

## Never Assume What the Hiring Manager Wants to Hear

Assumptions are the killer of dreams. Answering “_what are you looking for in your next job”_ with stock replies such as wanting to grow with the company and become CEO within six months may show ambition. However, if you failed to research the company, you might have missed that they rarely promote from within.

## How to Answer: What Are You Looking For in Your Next Role?

First and foremost, you must thoroughly research the company before attending the interview. Secondly, print off the job description, browse the website and social media channels, read the whitepaper and any other information available. Yes, this task is time-consuming and annoying if you send dozens of job applications weekly.

Still, you only need to do this task when you have an interview date. It’s a good exercise for establishing if the company is the right fit for your goals. When you genuinely find an organisation that aligns with your values, there’s a much greater chance of a successful interview, job offer and career progression within the company.

**Create a 4-step checklist pre-interview. Here are a few ideas: –**

1. Research the company story, which you might find on the  _About_  page on the website
2. Locate the LinkedIn profiles for the company and founders
3. Follow threads on social media channels like Twitter, Discord and Facebook: How do the company respond to followers? Are they engaging, helpful and present for all comments?
4. Read case studies, reviews, and testimonials

After that, collate the information, and you should get an overall picture of the organisation’s workplace culture, levels of customer service and efficiency in navigating complaints.

## Use the Job Description to Create Your Edge

The job description should be your bible pre-interview. Learn the core prerequisites, keywords and terms used to describe the ideal candidate. It could be you! Ideally, print the job description and learn it by heart so you can casually refer to essential items during the interview.

After that, you can start putting together a pitch for when the hiring manager asks,  _“what are you looking for in your next role?”_

## Examples of Ideal Answers to What are You Looking for?

Of course, you must use your own words, but the following answers are great examples of how to use your research to create a unique response to “_what are you looking for in this job?_

### How Not to Respond to “What are you Looking for in Your Next Job?”

**Tip #1: Do Not Falsify Information**

If you do not align with the job requirements, you will probably not enjoy the job if offered. Above all, never lie on your resume or during the interview. Hiring managers usually have a wealth of experience spotting Pinocchio’s among the candidates. Be authentic, open, and honest. It’s not a trick question. Primarily, hiring managers simply want to know if you are the right person for the job.

**Tip #2: Don’t Focus on the Salary**

Of course, money is important, and you want a good salary to match your experience. However, never lead with money when asked what you are looking for from a job—Focus 100% on demonstrating the value you can bring to the company. If you get a job offer, that’s the time to negotiate salary. However, it’s not unreasonable to ask about pay at the end of your interview, but don’t chase it at that point.

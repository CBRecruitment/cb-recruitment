## What Are Conceptual Skills?

As mentioned, conceptual skills are soft skills. However, whilst highly valuable in the workplace, you need the prerequisite hard skills for jobs requiring technical knowledge, such as blockchain developers, architects, and engineers. However, if you are a highly qualified developer, lacking the ability to think conceptionally may reduce your ability to problem-solve complex challenges.

The term “_conceptual skills_” may be on a job description as critical thinking, problem-solving or strategic thinking. However described, the meaning is that potential employees can reframe abstract ideas into workable solutions.

Conceptual skills in management are essential

### Examples of Conceptual Skills

All employees benefit from having any skills on the below list. Above all, conceptual skills needed by managers include: –

- Abstract-Thinking
- Active Listening
- Adaptability
- Analysis
- Creativity
- Critical-Thinking
- Delegation
- Flexibility
- Idea Formulation
- Innovative-Thinking
- Logical-Thinking
- Negotiation
- Open-Mindedness
- Organisation
- Planning
- Prioritisation
- Problem-Solving
- Research
- Resourcefulness
- Strategic-Thinking
- Vision

Any of the above could be an example of conceptual skills. Primarily, they all describe a person who can take the big picture and break it down into manageable chunks to create innovative solutions. It’s why conceptual skills in management are crucial to good leadership. Big-picture thinking is excellent, but it’s a useless capability unless you can condense it into usable data for a team.

If you apply for a job that mentions any of the above skills, use those specific words on your  [resume](https://cbrecruitment.com/resume-with-no-experience/). For example, if the job states it needs candidates with  _resourcefulness, problem-solving_ and _critical thinking skills_, there is no need to add further examples from the above list.

Subsequently, if the company uses applicant tracking software, it will likely look for the specific keywords from the job description in your resume. Indeed, it’s helpful to tailor your resume for each job application rather than send a generic one to all potential employers.

Conversely, suppose you possess other conceptual skills not mentioned. Discussing these capabilities during the first interview may be appropriate to show you are a well-rounded, capable individual with many valuable skills.

## Are Conceptual Skills Relevant to a Job Search?

The demand for top talent in Web3 is increasing exponentially. For every job opening, organisations receive hundreds of applications. Subsequently, if you want your resume selected for an interview, conceptual skills can get you noticed.

You can also use conceptual thinking to plan a strategic approach to finding the job of your dreams. Instead of blindly searching job sites, why not plan a roadmap for your job search? Research the company, browse the website and social media accounts, and founder profiles.

Study the language and tone of communication material and read reviews online if the organisation is product or service-based. When you have a big-picture view of the company, you can create a strategy for preparing your application to catch a hiring manager’s attention.

Likewise, use conceptual skills to identify the best opportunities that align with your needs and values. According to  [The State of the Global Workplace 2022 report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx), many employees hate their job. The report states that 60% feel emotionally detached at work, and 19% of employees feel utterly miserable. The reasons stated included poor leadership, a bad manager, a  [toxic environment](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-deal-with-a-toxic-work-environment/)  or lack of job satisfaction

Assuming you’re looking for a position where you feel engaged and excited about your daily tasks, why not start as you mean to go on? Use your conceptual thinking skills to only apply for jobs you are confident will tick most of the boxes.

## Conceptual Skills in Management

There is a multitude of reasons for poor management. Above all, it’s common sense to appreciate that conceptual skills in management will significantly affect how well a manager performs and how they relate to their teams. It’s the difference between a leader and a boss.

Thought leaders often display impressive conceptual skills. Problem-solving, creativity and innovation and other abstract thinking skills are fundamental and crucial if you’re considering management roles. It will make your job easier and help you create and develop a loyal and cohesive team.

In addition, if you can solve high-level problems in the organisation, you will become an indispensable and highly regarded member of the workforce. In addition, conceptual thinkers are more likely to be considered for promotion opportunities.

How do you define conceptual skills?

## What if you don’t have Conceptual Skills?

Developing any form of abstract thinking can significantly improve your demand in the job market. Above all, underestimating the need for problem-solving skills can be detrimental to your job hunt and lead to multiple application rejections.

You may think you don’t possess conceptual skills and aren’t capable of transforming complex, abstract ideas into innovative solutions. However, we believe that anyone can learn conceptual skills.

## Top 4 ways to Learn Conceptual Skills

### #1 Study Exceptional Conceptual Thinkers

In Neuro-Linguistic Programming, the presupposition is “_what one person can do, so can another_“, and that’s the fundamental rule for improving abstract thinking skills. Moreover, if there is someone in the workplace who you admire, ask if they will mentor you to help you develop the skills.

Attend team meetings, watch your mentor in action and make notes about how they approach a problem.

1. What do they say?
2. What do they do?
3. How do they do it?
4. Notice how they structure the big picture into bite-sized chunks
5. Do they invite input from others: Does the solution evolve from brainstorming ideas?
6. What other skills do they apply?

If there is nobody in the workplace to model, the alternative is to read books, watch videos, attend webinars or get training. In the vein of problem-solving, find a solution to improve your conceptual skills.

### #2 Find a Problem in the Workplace and Create a Solution

Identify a problem within the organisation and find a solution; start small and research the issue from every perspective. Discuss the situation with your manager and coworkers and gather ideas. For example, suppose the company has a high rate of customer complaints, and past solutions haven’t worked to resolve the issues.

**The following is an excellent example of conceptual thinking: –**

A car insurance company had a problem with customers complaining about the lateness of receiving payout cheques. Typically, the company dispatched customer payments within eight days.

The simple solution was to notify every client that they would receive their cheque within fourteen days. After that, there was a complete turnaround, and customers called the company expressing delight at receiving their cheques in (only) eight days.

This perfect solution addressed the real issue, which was customer uncertainty. By removing that, the problem disappeared because it changed customer expectations.

The above example demonstrates that you don’t need intense problem-solving skills. Simply put yourself in the “_shoes of the problem_” and reverse-think the solution.

Above all, if you find a solution to a workplace problem, take it to the right people and outline your idea. If the company adopts your concept and it works, you have created exceptional value. It’s a big achievement, which could lead to a promotion, and you can also add to your resume.

### #4 Create a Portfolio of Case Studies

It’s easy to spot online or offline companies “_getting it wrong_” and probably losing business.

**For instance, here are 4 potential problems with an online shop: –**

1. **Poor web design:**  Such as low-quality images, hard-to-read font, difficult navigation or content that is not customer-focused
2. **Weak customer journey experience:**  How easy is it to check out after purchase? Is there a lack of functionality or clarity? Many online shops lose customers in the checkout area for a multitude of reasons
3. **Lack of transparency:**  Widespread with many websites
4. **Inferior customer service:**  Hard to find the point of contact, no chat function or email address

Alternatively, find a physical business local to your home and identify problems. After a while, you notice your natural problem-solving skills become easier to access. After that, extend your reach to solve bigger business issues.

### #4 Volunteer to Work on a Project in a Different Department

If practical, offer to volunteer on a project where you can stretch your conceptual thinking skills. If your manager is open-minded, ask if you can spend a few hours a week working with a different team. Explain that you want to develop your conceptual skills to make you more effective in your job.

If you are unemployed, the same idea applies. Find a company you would like to work with and make contact to offer your services as a volunteer. If it goes well, it either gets you a job offer or, at the least, you can add this project work to your resume. Above all, get involved, and don’t hold back. The more you put into your work, the more you will get from it.

Choose from any of the four ideas and, if possible, aim for more than one. The more you use abstract thinking, the better it will become.

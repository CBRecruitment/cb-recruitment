## The top 10 common job interview questions

We’ve put together the most common job questions and answers. It’s not a definitive list, but navigating these typical early-stage top 10 interview questions will improve your confidence. After that, you can relax knowing you have the answers ready. If you need help preparing for a crypto interview,  [contact our experienced team at CB Recruitment](https://cbrecruitment.com/contact/).

## 1. Tell Me About Yourself

This question often catches candidates out. What do interviewers genuinely want to know about you? How many personal details do they require about your life?

Above all, the interviewer wants to see if you are the best person for the position. They don’t want to hear your entire life history, so choose your responses based on correlation with the job. For instance, perhaps you attend martial arts classes weekly. From this answer, the interviewer can assume you are a disciplined person who can commit to a long-term process.

You might want to share details if you have a quirky hobby. Talk briefly about your life journey and what aspects of your career you particularly enjoyed. Be confident in sharing your personality and be enthusiastic because it can help build rapport with the interviewer.

## 2. Why are you the best person for the job? Or why should we hire you?

If you are an introvert, you may feel uncomfortable about this question.

Before the interview, research the company, its mission statement, culture, ethics and vision. Study the job description in detail and “_pull out_” the salient points relevant to your experience.

### Ask yourself three questions: –

- Why should this company hire me?
- Is it what I truly want
- Do I have the qualifications and experience required?

State your response confidently and concisely, highlighting and factoring in your knowledge of the company and how it aligns with your application.

Above all, stick to the facts. For instance, if you are an experienced  [blockchain developer](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/) with proven skills, talk about how those skills apply to this role.

## 3. How has your experience prepared you for this position?

Remember, the interviewer might be asking you multiple questions, but the underlying goal for every question is to discover if you “a_re you the right person for the role?”_  so keep that at the forefront of your responses.

Subsequently, keep your answers 100% relevant to the role. List the qualifications, skills and experience that match the job description. Share your achievements with examples of overcoming pertinent challenges.

## 4. Why do you want this job?

Earlier, we mentioned researching the company. This question presents the opportunity to use this knowledge. Talk about what appeals to you about the company’s mission and culture. Be specific about what you like. Is it the reputation in the industry or the products or services? Many candidates fail to research a company, so your confident and knowledgeable response can help you stand out as a suitable candidate.

## 5. What is your greatest strength?

Your answer to this question must be 100% relevant to the role. You can highlight characteristics like determination, a problem solver and attention to detail. Above all, sharing a story about an instance where you utilised your strengths in a relevant project is more powerful.

For example, you could say,  _“When X company had an issue with (the problem), I quickly did (list what you did), and it solved the problem in less than 24 hours.”_

Describing a visual example of your strengths creates a picture in the interviewer’s mind, instantly making you more memorable than candidates that reel off lists of skills.

## 6. What is your greatest weakness?

It is one of the most common job interview questions. Nobody wants to admit weaknesses, so this question often catches out unprepared candidates. Whatever your answer, reframe it positively. For instance, perhaps you struggled with a specific coding language but committed to a course to improve your skills. Equally, an impatient attitude could be reframed as determination to get a job done quickly and efficiently.

Never admit to a weakness and leave it on the table. Always follow up with an outline of the steps taken to overcome issues. The required response underpinning this question is knowing if you can comfortably step up to challenges, learn new tasks and do what needs doing.

## 7. How do you handle stress and pressure?

1 in 4 adults suffers from stress. It’s an undeniable fact. Trying to deny the existence of stress in your life is unrealistic. Consequently, the interviewer wants to know how stress affects you in the workplace. What is your stress response? Do you cave under pressure or dig deep into your resources and coping strategies?

Before the interview, be honest with yourself about this question. Does this role require working under pressure? If so, how will you respond?

In a team environment, employees who can manage stress without imploding are invaluable to the workplace, especially if they lead a team. Share an example with the interviewer of how you have successfully navigated stress and coped with pressure in the workplace.

## 8. What are your salary requirements?

Ideally, you already know the salary for the position. If not, research the typical salary ranges for similar roles. Be clear (in your mind) about the minimum you’d be happy to accept, and then provide the interviewer with a salary range—for example, between £50,000 and £55,000.

If the job requires a location change, adjust your salary expectation to accommodate living expenses for the area. For instance, London’s living costs are considerably higher than most other places in the UK.

## 9. What are your goals for the future?

This question can be cloaked in different ways. For instance, interviewers may ask what you see yourself doing in five years.

If your resume shows multiple job moves over a period, it could concern a potential employer. Hiring and training new staff is expensive, so they want to know you’re likely to stick around.

Be prepared that a follow-up question could be about why you moved around so much with previous employers. Be honest but aim to frame it positively and align it to the job. For instance, you might say you were looking for a career with prospects.

## 10. Why do you want to leave (or have left) your current job?

Answering this question requires honesty but try to frame it to reflect your circumstances positively. Telling the interviewer you hated your previous boss will drastically reduce your chances of a second interview or a hire. Acceptable answers could include something like: –

- I’m looking for more of a challenge
- I’m relocating to this area
- I’ve been looking for a long time for a company that (list your reasons positively)
- I’ve upgraded my skills
- The company downsized (or closed)
- I feel like I’m not fulfilling my full potential

## How to prepare for job interview questions

The more preparation you do, the more you increase your chances of a successful interview. Failure to plan leads to waffling answers or uncomfortable silences. Neither instance is going to get you the job.

Before the interview, mentally run through the top 10 interview questions and your answers. This process can significantly improve your confidence and reduce stress levels. The objective is to aim for a relaxed interview.

## How to make a good impression in an interview

1. **Dress appropriately:**  Contact the interviewer to check the details if you’re unsure of the dress code.
2. **Attend the interview promptly:**  Allow sufficient time for travel delays. If the meeting is online, check your internet is working and that you understand how to work the technology of the meeting software.
3. **Reframe positively:**  Always adopt a positive attitude and an enthusiastic approach. Never criticise your current employer or team members.
4. **Follow up:**  Send a follow-up email to thank the interviewer for their time and express your interest in the job. In addition, add any questions you may have forgotten to ask during the interview.

## Conclusion: Powerful answers to the top 10 job interview questions

Practice your interview skills and your answers to the top 10 interview questions. Get a good night’s sleep before the day of the interview so that you are fresh and alert. Thoroughly research the company and know the job specification inside out. Tailor your answers honestly but maintain relevancy to the role.

Never be afraid to ask for clarification if there is something you are uncertain about, and take a brief moment before answering a question. The prefrontal cortex (the brain’s logical centre) is affected when we are stressed, and the limbic system kicks in, triggering the flight and fight response. Consequently, we jump into answering questions too quickly and then regret our response. Before the interview, practice counting a few seconds before responding. Breathe deeply and, if need be, ask for a moment to consider your answer.

In time and with practice, you can learn to enjoy interviews. Moreover, armed with this insider information, you’ll likely land the perfect crypto job much sooner.

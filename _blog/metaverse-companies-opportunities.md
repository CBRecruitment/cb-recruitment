## What is the Metaverse and how does it Work?

Few people can correctly state the definition of the metaverse and explain how it works. In a  [United States survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1302606/us-adults-heard-about-the-metaverse)  in 2022, 43% of adults said they had no knowledge of the metaverse or how it works. 1 in 10 adults said they had considerable awareness of the metaverse, and only 21% said they didn’t understand virtual reality.

The metaverse combines physical and digital worlds using revolutionary technology. The gaming industry is enormous, but the metaverse takes us into a new dimension where we can immerse ourselves in various life-like settings, meet people and their avatars, and buy and sell virtual real estate and commercial properties.

It may seem futuristic to imagine setting up a commercial estate where businesses pay you rental fees to set up their stores where they can sell physical and digital goods. It’s no wonder the metaverse uneducated population still thinks it’s something with no real-world use.

Realistically, anything you can do in the real world, you can do in the metaverse, such as trading, eCommerce, attending sporting events and concerts and more. The potential of the metaverse is endless, and it’s attracting a passionate community of people who are determined to become part of this growth industry.

[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)  is one of the most well-known metaverse platforms. It’s a 3D virtual world, browser-based platform. After its launch in December 2020, the public became immersed in exploring virtual worlds, trading, buying land and property and making money.

Decentraland was innovative at the time, but  [Bit.Country](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/bit-country-review/)  took it further in 2021 by creating a beginner-friendly metaverse where users can create a metaverse of their own.

Imagine creating a startup business where you have all the tools for success. After securing a land plot, you can trade, sell, or rent space in your metaverse to real-world businesses. It may sound surreal, but it’s the next stage of the metaverse.

Considering the vast potential of the metaverse, is it any surprise that so many people want to work for metaverse companies?

## Will we Work Inside the Metaverse in the Future?

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, believes that, within five years, employees will work daily in a metaverse workplace.

Since the onset of the global pandemic, we’ve become familiar with a hybrid work model, and undoubtedly organisations are focusing on how to improve the experience and make it more immersive.

Imagine working anywhere in the world in a virtual reality environment that feels the same as working in an office. It’s likely to happen as a  [PwC report](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/emerging-tech/demystifying-the-metaverse.html)  suggests that 85% of leaders expect to factor the metaverse into their business plan over the next three years.

Mark Purdy, a writer for Writing for Harvard Business Review, said, “_Imagine a world where you could have a beachside conversation with your colleagues, take meeting notes while floating around a space station, or teleport from your office in London to New York, all without taking a step outside your front door.”_

_“Feeling under pressure with too many meetings scheduled today? Then why not send your AI-enabled digital twin instead to take the load off your shoulders?”_

In addition, Mark added, “_The metaverse could revolutionise training and skills development, drastically compressing the time needed to develop and acquire new skills.”_

PwC believes that the metaverse is an evolution rather than a revolution. It states, “_Key metaverse concepts, including digital economy innovations such as cryptocurrencies, are business-relevant today.”_

Companies working on metaverse implementation realise that the cutting-edge technology underpinning the metaverse will help to future-proof their companies. It will create new and innovative revenue streams. Indeed, most believe the metaverse will be essential to their business growth over the next few years.

It’s an exciting time for anyone exploring working for metaverse companies to launch a new career in Web3.

## Examples of Top Metaverse Companies

Several of the leading tech giants have become pioneers in implementing metaverse technology.

- Mark Zuckerberg’s  [Meta](https://about.meta.com/)  created “Horizon Rooms”, a virtual reality team meeting space
- Cisco: Created an AR (augmented reality) tool, “[Webex Hologram](https://projectworkplace.cisco.com/capabilities/hologram),” for team meetings
- Microsoft: Created  [Microsoft Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh)  to enable collaboration between colleagues in immersive virtual reality spaces
- [PixelMax:](https://pixelmax.com/)  A UK startup launched a metaverse company offering virtual workplaces, training, and showrooms. The Digital Twin technology allows a company to “_Make a digital twin of any physical space that can be accessed from anywhere in the world at any time.”_
- [NextMeet](https://nextmeet.live/)  created an immersive avatar-based PC/VR metaverse platform for meetings, business networking, distance learning, and virtual events such as trade fairs, launches and conferences. You simply download the software, create an account, organise a session and start your meeting

## The Top Metaverse Companies

There are multiple operational metaverse companies, but the below are the most well-known: –

[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)  is a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. After launching in 2020, it has quickly become one of the most well-known in the metaverse space.

[The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/shop/)  gaming platform originated in 2012 and is another 3D virtual world powered by the Ethereum blockchain

[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)  is an NFT-based gaming platform launched in 2018. It is an in-game economy using Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies. Axie quickly became popular, but in 2022, hackers took control of four of the nine cryptographic keys after a developer clicked on a link in a PDF. The cyberhackers escaped with $625 million of assets.

Cyber Security is as vital for metaverse platforms as any business, and, as a result of the experience, users lost trust in the Axie platform and left in droves. It’s one of the primary reasons people are rushing to  [train as Cyber Security Engineers](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-cyber-security-engineer/)  in 2023.

[Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/)  is not as well known as the other three platforms, but Roblox is a gaming platform that has seen high growth. With over 47 million users and a base of over 9.5 million developers, it is fast becoming a popular game development environment where users can play games created by developers or create games of their own.

Metaverse companies will transform our working experience

## How to Prepare for Applying to Metaverse Companies

Preparation is vital when sending applications to specific metaverse companies or organisations implementing metaverse technology. Above all, it’s an exciting time for qualified candidates seeking Web3 careers.

Firstly, decide which aspect of the metaverse appeals to you and target your focus in building the prerequisite skills. Secondly, do you want to work with a metaverse brand or one deploying metaverse technology?

There are notable examples of organisations using metaverse technology, such as  [Medivis](https://www.medavis.com/), a surgical tech company that uses interactive 3D anatomy models to train students in the healthcare industry.

BMW uses  [digital twin technologies](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/13/nvidia-bmw-factory-future/)  to test, optimise efficiency, and visualise the automotive factories. Teams can collaborate in real-time, in one virtual space, working in 3D to improve the factories. In addition, the technology enables digital humans in simulations for testing and improving workflow.

## Conclusion: How Will Metaverse Companies Create Incredible Future Work Opportunities

[![companies working on metaverse technology](http://cbrecruitment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/metaverse-7252038_1280-1024x682.jpg)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/metaverse-virtual-reality-man-7252038/)

Candidates are hungry to join companies working on metaverse technology

Metaverse companies not only need candidates with technical skills, such as  [metaverse developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-metaverse-developer/)  and other  [metaverse jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/metaverse-jobs/). They also hire advertising and branding experts, social media and community managers, administrators, sales,  [product marketing managers](https://cbrecruitment.com/product-marketing-manager-career/)  etc. The joy of Web3 is many of the existing job skills are transferable to the space.

It might seem unimaginable that most of us could soon be working in the metaverse, and, for many, it may be a step too far. CEO of Strauss Zelnick (a gaming development company) fears that we will end up in a world where working in the metaverse is our commonplace daily practice. Zelnick said, “_I’m skeptical that we’re going to wake up in the morning and intentionally sit at home, strap on our headsets and conduct all of our daily activities that way. We had to do that during the pandemic, and we don’t really like it so much.”_

Historically, we all know we cannot stem the tide of technology. We are hungry for it. Still, there is an argument that we are fast becoming more displaced from genuine human connection. We adapted to the isolation of working from home during the global lockdown in 2020. Covid-19 may have changed the face of the workplace forever. Indeed, it’s unimaginable for many to consider commuting to an office and working physically close to others.

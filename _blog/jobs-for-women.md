The number of opportunities for jobs for women in Web3 is increasing and the gender differences in BigTech is gradually shifting.

In 2014, the founder of Polkadot, Gavin Wood, first described a decentralised, blockchain-based online ecosystem using the term “_Web3_.” Many people think Web3 will be the future of the Internet, with autonomous and decentralised platforms potentially challenging the dominance of media giants such as Facebook, Google and Twitter.

Web3 encompasses cryptocurrencies and blockchains, but the bigger picture is a future where users can create and monetise their own content platforms using decentralised apps (dApps). In addition, users will no longer have to depend on the BigTechs that can change the rules, use our data and close accounts because they are custodians of user content.

In Web3, we may no longer need centralised payment services like PayPal, GooglePay and Apple Pay. Instead, we can securely and directly transact with each other, cutting out the custodian intermediaries.

Considering that Web3 has a total market cap of $27.5 billion and Facebook alone has $900 billion, the potential for Web3 is untapped. The combined value of BigTech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook is around $14.8 trillion, five hundred times more than the combined total of the top Web3 metaverse crypto companies.

According to  [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/web-3-0-blockchain-market-report), in 2021, the Web3 blockchain market was $1.36 billion. The estimated CAGR from 2022 to 2030 is 44.9%. With such scope for growth, CB Recruitment is seeing an increase in demand for talented Web3 candidates, and there’s no reason to assume gender differentiation. However, the fact remains that fewer women apply for  [Web3 jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/).

**Here are a few interesting snippets of data regarding jobs for women:**

- Only 23% of Google US-based employees in 2020 were women
- Only 37% of Tech startups have one woman or more on the board of directors
- Women hold only 14% of software engineering positions and 25% of computer science-based jobs
- 30% of women older than 35 are still working in junior roles

In this article, we unfold the reasons for the male-dominated Tech space and consider crucial steps to help get jobs for women in Web3. The PwC UK  [“Women in Tech – Time to close the gender gap”](https://www.pwc.co.uk/women-in-technology/women-in-tech-report.pdf)  report states that “78% of students could not name a famous female working in tech”. We hope this article will go some way to encouraging awareness of the opportunities for high paying jobs for women in Web3.

## The Good News about High-Paying Jobs for Women

The  [statistics](https://www.fenews.co.uk/education/ucas-record-82-increase-in-uk-women-applying-to-it-degrees)  suggest that only 1 in 5 women apply for computer science degrees. However, there has been an 82% increase in females over the last decade, applying for IT courses at UK universities. In addition, since 2019, 10% more women have applied for computer science roles, compared to only a 2% increase for males.

The Office for National Statistics revealed job growth between July to September 2021 in the tech industry was the third fastest-growing in the UK. Moreover, 71% of professionals placed in this period were women.

During the pandemic, the Web3 industry did not slow down—quite the opposite. Web3 has a flexible work culture with many employees working remotely, which levelled the gender playing field. It enabled women to juggle family commitments with work without compromising the work-life balance.

This trend for the shift in jobs for women in Web3 will likely continue as more women understand that not every job in Web3 requires technical skills.

## Highest Paying Jobs for Women are not all About Tech

There are a plethora of good jobs for women without technical skills. Moreover, all Web3 companies need professional employees in marketing, administration, human resources, accounts, legal, social media and much more. Subsequently, these skills are transferable.

Whilst it helps to have an understanding of Web3 and all it encompasses, it’s not essential. For example, if you were joining a company in the building industry, you wouldn’t be expected to know bricks and mortar. Like any industry, in Web3 companies, you can learn from experience.

For women, this knowledge opens up exciting opportunities to pursue a chosen career in the Web3 space. Possessing a sense of curiosity and openness to learning is more important than understanding the complexities and differentials in Web3.

## Prominent Women in Web3

Women worldwide are discovering a passion for and an interest in creating a career in Web3. These women have created jobs for women in the space and demonstrated that it doesn’t have to be an industry only available to men. The following are five women with outstanding results in the Web3 space: –

1. Brit Morin founded  [BFF](https://www.mybff.xyz/), a female community teaching women how to benefit from cryptocurrencies. The community has over 50 celebrity members, including Mila Kunis and Gwyneth Paltrow
2. [Black Women Blockchain Council](https://bwbc.io/event-gallery/): A business launched in 2018 to introduce more black women into the cryptocurrency industry
3. Visual artist Maliha Abidi launched the  [WomenRise](https://womenrise.art/), a collection of 10,000 randomly generated NFTs that represent women worldwide
4. Randi Zuckerburg, sister of Mark, launched the  [Big Hug](https://www.thehug.xyz/)  accelerator to help fund and mentor female creators
5. Mars House: Founder Krista Kim sold the first  [NFT digital house](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/03/22/mars-house-krista-kim-nft-news/)  for half a million dollars

These women are changing the face of gender discrimination by proving a woman can succeed in Tech. However, they aren’t female employees. Although they may have encountered some discrimination, the results of their applaudable efforts go some way to shifting unconscious bias in the workplace. Still, what does the average woman business have to overcome in her search for a Web3 career

In the next section, we disclose a few ideas for organisations to change their culture and policies to better support women in Tech.

## Changing Unconscious Bias for High Paying Jobs for Women

The challenge with unconscious bias is the lack of awareness. Businesses may assume gender for specific jobs, leading to gender discrimination. For instance, suppose you have a friend who tells you about a colleague studying for a nursing degree. You may find yourself assuming the colleague is a woman. Equally, you automatically imagine the CEO of a tech company is a man.

Breaking away from subconscious biases is no easy task. Still, it’s possible with training and feedback. Companies can also do blind screening of candidates, so there is no opportunity for a bias to discriminate.

This bias has nothing to do with feminism. It’s more related to the expected norm, conditioning in the workplace because men have led the tech industry for a long time.

## Equal Pay for All

If we are ever to achieve diversity in the tech space, an excellent start is to implement policies for equal pay for men and women in the same roles. In addition, everyone should have equal growth opportunities. These tweaks in gender bias can shift a workplace culture to attract and retain top-talent candidates.

## Support Employees Returning to the Workplace

It is more cost-effective for a company to hire an employee returning to the tech workplace that has prior experience but may need to update skills. For example, if an employee has maternity or sickness leave, spending a little on training is more beneficial than hiring someone brand new to the tech space.

## Encourage a Workplace Culture that Embraces Diversity

[Retaining employees](https://cbrecruitment.com/employee-retention-strategies/)  can be challenging for many organisations, and employers are often baffled by a high staff turnover. Considering that the spectrum of gender types and ages varies in most companies, how easy is it to implement a culture that embraces employee differences?

For instance, more organisations are building support and providing policies for menopausal employees, typically aged between 50 to 64, representing 5 million employees in the UK.

Statistics from April 2022 suggest that 600 organisations signed the campaign for the  [Menopause Workplace Pledge](https://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/news/over-600-employers-sign-the-menopause-workplace-pledge). Top companies such as TSB, the Co-op, BBC, AstraZeneca, and London Zoo supported the campaign.

The facts show that 1 million women quit their jobs because of perimenopause or menopause symptoms. It can also cause women to reduce their working hours or reject promotion opportunities. With some help and support, organisations can work on retaining female employees who might otherwise leave.

## Preparing Women for Careers in Web3

Any job you are doing outside of Web3 is transferable to the space. However, if you want to work in Web3, gaining some knowledge of what it encompasses is helpful.

Typically, for every  [Web3 job](https://cbrecruitment.com/web3-jobs/)  advertised, there are hundreds of applications. If your resume shows some knowledge or experience with Web3, it increases your chances of getting an interview.

Conversely, some organisations look for experts in their field, such as marketing, SEO, social media etc. Therefore, with proof of success, you can demonstrate that you can bring value even in the tech space. For example, a marketing professional can present data for an ROI for previous clients.

## Conclusion: Jobs for Women in Web3: Best Opportunities in 2022

It may take time to create a shift in the belief that women cannot work in Tech. Women are discovering they are more than capable of learning about blockchain technology, NFTs, DeFi and the metaverse. Not only that, Web3 careers offer some of the most rewarding and lucrative opportunities for the right people, whatever gender.

In addition, many online courses are available to learn basic Web3 skills or even train in blockchain development,  [video game design](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-video-game-designer/), coding, or app development. Moreover, if you are a skilled writer with a passion for creativity, there are opportunities to work with a gaming studio as a  [video game writer](https://cbrecruitment.com/video-game-writer/). Realistically, the diversity in the Web3 space offers something for everyone.

The best opportunities in 2022 for women are those you create for yourself. There is no limit on what you can achieve once you decide what aspect of Web3 interests you.

## What is a Video Game Writer?

Every video game needs a story. Above all, a video game writer works with a design team to craft stories, create character descriptions, and write a script. In addition, video games writers write game tutorials and dialogue for in-action characters’ gameplay.

You’ll work alongside game designers, developers, level designers, and programmers to build an appealing game for users. Moreover, you’ll need excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as being good at video game writing. In addition, the ability to convey concepts to your team is a great bonus.

## What do video game writers do?

Video game writers are involved at every stage of video game production. It’s certainly not as simple as writing a script and leaving the designers and developers to implement the narrative. Your role as a writer will be an integral part of completing a successful project.

### Conception

You will work closely with the design team to create and develop the structure of the video game and outline a plot. At this stage, you will research the type of video game and decide how much writing is needed. Some games don’t require a lot of narratives, so writers become more involved in the design and coding of the game. For instance, a role-playing game (RPG) requires more narrative than an action game. In that case, video game writers are less involved in design and coding and focus more on the storyline.

### Preproduction preparation

After the initial outline of the game is decided, the next stage is to start writing storylines, character profiles and backgrounds, dialogues, and level overviews. As some video games have multiple in-game options, the video game writer must write scripts for various storylines.

### Production

At this stage, the game writer produces quest texts, dialogue cutscenes and any other writing needed, including drafting tutorials. If the game requires a lot of narratives, you could be working with voice actors and the game director in recording sessions so that you can tweak text as necessary.

### Postproduction

After signing off the production stage, the game writer proofreads the text by playing the entire game to check for errors or make improvements.

## What skills do video game writers need?

![video game writing](http://cbrecruitment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/videogamewriting.jpg)

Image  [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/video-game-writing)

For many jobs working in  [blockchain](https://cbrecruitment.com/5-most-in-demand-cryptocurrency-jobs/), candidates requires significant technical skills. For video game writing, technical knowledge isn’t strictly essential. That said, you may not enjoy the immersive role of a video game writer unless you have a passion for gaming and some understanding of coding.

**In addition, you’ll need the following skills: –**

1. **Creative writing:**  You are a skilled storyteller with a lively imagination who can transform a concept into an interactive story that gamers want to play
2. **Game playing experience:**  Video games narrative has a particular style, and you must, at all stages, consider what gamers enjoy. If you do not know about playing video games, it could be a challenge to create a narrative that works
3. **Communication and collaboration:**  Producing a video game requires exceptional cooperation between the team. For instance, the game designer might have fixed ideas that you are comfortable challenging in a non-confrontational way
4. **Understanding of coding:**  Video game designers expect writers to understand how to code, so they know the language. Moreover, when you’re presenting ideas to the designer, a basic familiarity with coding can help you convey script outlines aligned with coding practices

## How to Become a Video Game Writer

Whether you want to become a freelance video game writer or work as a full-time employee, starting your career in this exciting niche might be easier than you imagine: –

### Scriptwriting Qualifications

Some companies list a prerequisite of a scriptwriting bachelor’s degree, but it’s not always necessary.

**Other options are: –**

- Game design courses
- Video game writer courses
- Creative writing skills
- Coding ability
- Intern with a company to gain hands-on experience

### Create a writing portfolio

Publish short stories online in digital publications or literary journals. Alternatively, build an online portfolio of your own. In addition, write multiple games of your own to demonstrate your storytelling skills for video games.

### Get involved with the industry

Networking in the video game industry is essential to keep your finger on the pulse. Follow the  [IGN](https://www.ign.com/uk)  website for gaming industry news, reviews, videos, guides and more. In addition, become a member of the  [International Game Developers Association](https://igda.org/)  (IGDA), a non-profit organisation for game developers, where you can also find details of upcoming events.

### Get real-life experience

If you have little experience in video game writing, approach companies for other positions in relevant departments like marketing, technical writing, or production. You could also volunteer your services to a small game production team as a way to learn about the industry.

For smaller or less narrative-driven games, video game writers may also play a considerable role in the coding and designing aspects of the physical gameplay. Larger, more narrative-driven projects usually hire writers who exclusively work on the story with few other responsibilities.

## Video game writer salary

How much do video game writers make? Above all, video game writing is not the highest-paid position in blockchain-based games, and freelancers may earn more than employees. The average salary is between £35,000 to £55,000, but some senior video game writers may make considerably more.

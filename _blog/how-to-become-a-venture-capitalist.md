## What is a venture capitalist?

A venture capitalist (VC) is a person that finances start-up companies or new businesses with potential for significant growth. What does VC stand for? “_VC_” is an abbreviation for “_venture capitalist.”_

More people today want to know how to become a venture capitalist. Interest in venture capitalism from newly qualified MBA’s is increasing. Unfortunately, there isn’t a mass-market of  [VC jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/contact/)  available, so how can you stand out and get hired by a VC company?

Firstly, you may believe that you need a degree and a set of impressive credentials on your resume. An MBA may help you to get a foot in the door, but it’s not a guarantee for securing a VC job. Secondly, let’s clear the misconception that you need significant capital to become a venture capitalist.

New positions in VC firms rarely make it to job boards. So, if working in venture capitalism is something you desire, be active and make yourself visible, rather than waiting for an opportunity to come to you.

VC associates’ annual salaries and bonuses vary considerably depending on several factors, such as the size of the venture capital firm. A venture capitalist salary is £78,000 to £120,000 or more with bonuses.

The online  [NVCA](https://nvca.org/)  report the following data: –

- $244 billion was spent in 2020 on research and development from VC-backed public companies
- 960% employment growth at VC-backed companies (1990 – 2020)
- 75% of the largest US companies would not exist or have grown without VC input

## How to become a venture capitalist with zero capital

You may not necessarily need money as an independent VC. Still, you must have the skills and confidence to source potential deals and, for instance, find entrepreneurs developing innovative and emerging technologies. In this instance, you either have an impressive source of connections or know the ideal places to meet new start-ups with growth potential.

Once you’ve identified a company of interest, the next step is to do your due diligence. Firstly, do you comprehensively understand the industry? If your knowledge isn’t in-depth, you must find experts who you can consult for a professional opinion on how the industry might develop.

Secondly, do you have the research skills to dig deep into the founders’ background? You might not find everything you need online, so your research could include contacting previous customers, employers etc. It’s also essential to assess a founder’s management style. A founder obsessed with micromanaging details (and people) may clash with the venture capitalist’s ideas for business development.

Doing these first two tasks helps you gather enough data to determine if the project “_has legs”_  and create a persuasive presentation.

## How to negotiate a venture capital deal

Many entrepreneurs are fantastic at creating a business idea but may have a “_big picture_” overview and resent dealing with the essentials of documenting and organising finances.

You’ll achieve more success if you develop exceptional negotiation skills. For instance, how much venture capital is the founder requesting? Is it enough or too little? Have they calculated an accurate valuation and acceptable terms of entry for a VC?

At the early stage, honest and open communication is essential, asking difficult questions and challenging inaccurate or assumptive information. Both parties need clarification on how to implement venture capital into a business.

Be 100% honest about your role and refrain from stating that you represent or have a working relationship with a VC firm. Likewise, explain your position as an independent VC consultant when you present the start-up company to the venture capital firm. Any misinformation at this stage could damage your reputation if you falsify that you’re a start-up team member.

## How to finance a new start-up

At this stage, you’re ready to finance the start-up, and as you don’t have sufficient capital, the next step is to find willing investors. It may seem daunting, but money will chase a potentially profitable start-up if you have identified a compelling opportunity.

Venture capitalists (sometimes called “angels”) always look for the next opportunity to support and help develop exciting start-ups. However, you’ll succeed more if you’ve already pre-established relationships with VCs. If you want a VC to take a meeting with you, you’ll get through the first step if they already trust you as a person and understand the independent role you’re working hard to establish.

## Top tips for how to become a venture capitalist

### Become active in entrepreneurial communities

Start creating relationships with and connections to entrepreneurs. Develop a reputation as a people connector. Become a person who can be trusted and has exceptional knowledge of finance and start-ups. Start your own company or join a start-up to develop your skills and experience.

### Create a social profile

Build a social presence online and consistently share your knowledge with your followers. It can take time, but after a point, momentum increases, and you become a “_name_” in the VC community. Building an extensive, relevant network can underpin your VC career. When your network understands what you do, followers will refer new start-ups to you, and some may want to help with your research process.

### Identify which VC firms you want to work with

Whether looking for a job with a venture capital firm or working as an independent VC, identify the firms that interest you. Learn everything about the company, and immerse yourself in the details. During an interview, enthusiasm for the company can sometimes override experience and skills. Follow the partners on social media accounts, such as Twitter, and attend hosted events like webinars.

### Deep research

Do a deep dive into one aspect of the start-up world and create a presentation with relevant data. This approach shows a company that you have excellent research and presentation skills.

A typical interview question that VC firms ask is about your preferred technologies, the markets and the products you like. A confident and enthusiastic answer helps you stand out among other candidates who haven’t done the deep research you have.

### Create a “paper” VC portfolio

Practice identifying new start-ups, research the project and estimate the potential growth. Track the company so you can gather data for your success.

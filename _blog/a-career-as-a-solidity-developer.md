## What is Solidity?

Solidity is a high-level, contract-orientated programming language developers use to write decentralised applications, smart contracts and self-executing Ethereum scripts. In addition, Solidity has an instruction set and a compiler that converts code into bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The Solidity language’s modular syntax and simple semantics help developers solve common problems associated with smart contract languages. Moreover, influenced by other languages, such as Python, C++ and Javascript, Solidity is easily readable and supports many programming styles, such as object-oriented design and functional programming.

### Who Created Solidity?

Gavin Wood, the founder of the Ethereum network, created Solidity to enable the creation of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It was the first object-oriented programming language (OOP). Above all, it was developed to improve on Bitcoin’s scalability shortcomings by generating dApps.

### How Does Solidity Work?

To create a smart contract with Solidity, primarily a user needs an Ethereum address for sending and receiving funds. In additon, users require an Ethereum compiler to compile a code that the EVM can understand. After that, the code converts into EVMs bytecode when a contract is validated and completed in Solidity.

In addition, Solidity developers can use Solidity with any EVM-based network, and it’s become a popular language for creating blockchain-based applications.

### What’s the Benefit of Using Solidity?

Because Solidity is a high-level programming language, it removes the need for typing code in zeros and ones. Subsequently, this benefit makes Solidity easier for developers to write programs.

As Ethereum smart contracts become more popular, more companies are using Solidity as the primary language for developing dApps. Subsequently, Solidity developers are in high demand. There’s never been a better time to learn how to become a Solidity developer.

## How to Become a Solidity Developer

Above all, follow the strategic steps to become a Solidity developer, and you’ll soon find a new career in this exciting field.

1. Learn object-oriented programming languages like C++, Python or JavaScript
2. Become familiar with data structures like maps and lists
3. Gain a good working knowledge of every aspect of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
4. Start developing projects with the Solidity language for smart contracts on the Ethereum network

## What do Solidity Developers Do?

What is a Solidity developer? Primarily, Solidity developers design, develop and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Likewise, they can confidently write auditable, secure and efficient open-source code and create dApps on Ethereum with Solidity.

### How Quickly Can you Learn Solidity?

If you apply yourself and commit to learning, you could be up and running as a Solidity developer in two to six months. Above all, you will find learning easier if you have prior knowledge of programming languages.

In addition, Solidity developers must understand Remix, which is a user-friendly, browser-based IDE (Solidity-specific integrated development environment). Primarily, Remix is a highly-effective tool for developers working with Solidity, as they do not have to download and install the software.

- Remix integrates with the EVM and compiler
- Provides syntax highlighting & auto-completion
- Enables one-click deployment of smart contracts to a chain

The following training course suggests users can complete with five hours of study.

## What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?

Ethereum is a decentralised platform for running secure applications. In addition, it is censorship-free, with no middlemen.

EVM runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is the environment for smart contracts. Likewise, every Ethereum network node running a node must execute via the EVM.

1. The international system of connected nodes ensures the performance and security of unauthorised programs
2. It prevents Denial-of-Service attacks
3. Verifies that applications cannot access each other’s states
4. Maintains communication without direct involvement

### Use-cases for Solidity in Ethereum

Solidity generates NFT and fungible smart contracts on the Ethereum network, which uses specific standards for creating tokens. Subsequently, Ethereum blockchain users can create a wide range of use-case types.

In addition, Solidity also allows the creation of a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation), a community-driven decentralised organisation where members construct the rules without the influence of a central government.

Solidity can segregate the data and logic in smart contracts and gives inheritance features and Solidity developers can store data in a smart contract by creating specific instructions.

Developers can use Solidity in  [DeFi](https://cbrecruitment.com/defi-jobs/)  Projects to create incentivised staking contracts (users deposit a token, and they receive rewards with a new token). In addition, it can also be used to develop borrowing and lending protocols.

## What is a Solidity Smart Contract?

A Solidity smart contract is simply a collection of code (functions) and data (location) residing at a specific location on the Ethereum blockchain. As a starting point, smart contracts include all the associated functions and variations required for business logic. Primarily, Solidity has several basic types that users can combine and create more sophisticated types.

## Pros and Cons of Working as a Solidity Developer

Every job has pros and cons, but how about working as a Solidity developer?

### Eight Pros of Solidity

## Solidity Developer Salary

Solidity developers are well-paid for their services. Subsequently, salaries range from £40,000 to £180,000 depending on qualifications and experience. Many Solidity developers operate as freelancers, working on short- or long-term contracts, which can be lucrative.

### Solidity Developers Job Search

Firstly, decide if you want a salaried or contract position. After that, determine if you want to work for a large organisation or would be happier contributing to a small business or startup. Though the latter may be high risk, the rewards can be significant if a startup team gets substantial  [venture capital funding](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-venture-capitalist/), especially in the Web3 space.

Many big-tech organisations now embrace blockchain technology, such as Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon. However, getting an interview can be challenging because of hundreds of applicants for every position advertised.

Above all, if you want to work for a top-tier company, contact the CB Recruitment team, as the experienced group of specialists work with many high-calibre organisations.

## Can Solidity Developers Work from Home?

The good news is that most Solidity developer positions offer remote working. Subsequently, there are no limitations to where you can apply for a job. However, many companies prefer applications from candidates in the same time zone because of the communication difficulties of setting up meetings etc.

Working from home sounds like a dream life, but it doesn’t come without challenges. It can be isolating, and after a while, motivation can decline. It requires self-discipline and determination to get the work completed.

Ideally, choose a company where you can regularly connect with colleagues and team members.

## You have a Solidity Developer Certification. Now What?

There is an increasing demand for Solidity developers. However, most organisations want the most experienced candidates and pay a premium salary to get the best talent in Web3.

There is no doubt you will find a great job, but here is a list of three tips to help get you started as a Solidity developer: –

1. **Become a freelance contractor:**  It’s a great way to build a portfolio to show potential employers
2. **Network:**  Build up your network of connections. The adage “_it’s not what you know but who you know_” often applies in Web3, and one contact could point you to your first Solidity developer role
3. **Register with a Web3 talent specialist:**  CB Recruitment’s vision is “_building the Web3 workforce of tomorrow_“, and they are committed to “_Making Web3 work_.” The  [experienced specialist team](https://cbrecruitment.com/contact/)  can connect you with some of the best companies in Web3 and will work with you to find an entry-level or senior position as a Solidity developer

Web3 is still relatively uncharted territory but it’s evolving fast, with many opportunities opening for technical and non-technical web3 jobs. In addition, web3 incorporates: –

- [NFTs](https://cbrecruitment.com/best-5-nft-jobs/)  (non-fungible tokens)
- The  [metaverse](https://cbrecruitment.com/metaverse-jobs/)
- Token economy
- [Cryptocurrency](https://cbrecruitment.com/entry-level-cryptocurrency-jobs-with-no-experience/)
- Virtual & Augmented Reality
- Advanced blockchain technologies
- and much more.

In simple terms, web3 is the new era of the world wide web. Above all, its decentralised nature significantly impacts future potential of web 3.0.

##### Web3 development will take the web to new levels, such as: –

- Better data connecting
- Improved user interaction
- More user control of data
- Enhanced security
- More opportunities for content creation
- Content creators have more control over ownership of their work
- Trustless transactions (with no middlemen)
- Easier to share knowledge
- It will change the way humans collaborate

Web3 Is not fully actualised yet as it must evolve from web 1.0 and web 2.0, and that certainly involves implementing significant changes.

This guide focuses on the jobs available in web3 in 2022. In addition, we’ll closely examine three technical web3 jobs and four non-technical web3 jobs, allowing everyone interested in a web 3.0 career to get started.

## **The Evolution of the World Wide Web**

When the web began, it was significantly different from how it is today. Moreover, it has certainly evolved and will soon bear little resemblance to how we first transacted with the web.

### **What is Web 1.0?**

Web 1.0 was the first version of the internet, driven almost solely by web developers building websites with static file content such as images and text. At the time, websites had little interactivity potential for users.

### **What is Web 2.0?**

Primarily, web 2.0 is how we see the web today. It’s more interactive than web 1.00 and it’s more social. In addition, with the advent of user-friendly apps, anyone can create and share content for global interaction. We are no longer reliant on web developers to create content.

## Why work in Web3?

Above all, it’s an exciting time to be starting a career in web3 jobs, though in many ways, web 3.0 is still in its infancy. However, as more companies embrace digital technology, they need qualified staff to help develop and incorporate web3.

Because there’s a shortage of top talent in web3, companies offer a high salary even for non-technical positions. You can develop a rewarding career as an engineer, a marketing professional, technical recruiting and even sales.

## The top 4 non-technical web3 jobs

## 1. Web3 Marketing Officer

Every business needs a marketing strategy, so if you have marketing experience, there are numerous opportunities to work in web3. Still, whilst you don’t need technical skills in this environment, it would be helpful if you have a good understanding of web3, blockchain, NFTs, etc.

## 2. Web3 Community Manager

A web3 community manager is a responsible role. Above all, it’s a job where you set the tone for the company that employs you. Moreover, most web3 projects are community-driven. As a result, how you direct the community can significantly impact project progression.

To become a community manager, decide what niche interests you. Moreover, it’s a full-on role, and it’s not for everyone, so at least choose something you will enjoy. For instance, a community manager in an NFT project differs from a DeFI project. For example, in a DeFi community, your role is to encourage people to use the platform.

Meanwhile, in an NFT community, your job is to create energy for the NFT project, so you’ll build a vibrant community. Therefore, it’s best to find a web3 community manager role that suits your personality.

##### Become familiar with web3 tools used by community managers: –

- Discord: Most web3’s have a Discord server to organise their communities
- Twitter
- Notion: A platform to manage information

- Medium: A blogging platform for weekly updates and blog posts

Firstly, become familiar with web3 projects by joining a few Discord servers that align with your interests and a community you’d be happy to manage. Secondly, become an active member so a community gets to know you. Meanwhile, offer to perform web3 tasks and build your reputation.

Finally, take notes of what web3 projects you’ve worked on so you can highlight these tasks when talking to a hiring manager.

### **What is a Web3 Community Manager’s Salary?**

Web3 community manager’s salaries can vary depending on whether you work part-time or are employed full-time. The former may pay around £500 a week. However, full-time web3 community managers can earn from £40,000 and up to £145,000+.

## 3. Web3 Public Relations Manager

Every company needs PR to create awareness and excitement for its services, new products etc. If you are a PR expert, transferring your skills to web3 is straightforward but requires understanding web3, the metaverse, NFTs etc. For instance, you could be creating advertising campaigns for virtual worlds.

##### Within web3, you may be working with various projects, such as: –

- **NFTs:**  Creating PR for new NFT (non-fungible tokens) collections
- **Play2Earn:**  Players get digital rewards for playing games. PR managers must find a way to maximise the opportunities on a play2earn platform
- **GameFi:**  Blockchain gaming platforms are increasing in popularity. A PR campaign finds ways to monetise games and help players earn digital currency

In today’s emerging web3, users want more control of their experiences and to be part of a thriving community. Above all, PR managers must create targeted, personalised, authentic and transparent campaigns.

### **What is a Web3 Public Relations Manager’s Salary?**

Web3 PR managers can make a good income, depending on experience, ranging from £40,000 to £175,000+.

## 4. Web3 Technical Recruiter

The demand for top talent in web3 is increasing exponentially. However, there is a shortage of qualified and experienced candidates. A technical recruiter role includes: –

- Screening and interviewing candidates
- Assisting with resumes for a role
- Helping prepare candidates for interview
- Talking to companies to encourage them to sign with your agency
- Preparing job specifications

Technical recruitment is a challenging job. Above all, you’ll need to understand and converse on multiple complex roles with candidates and clients. In addition, you’ll have at least two years of IT recruitment experience and a solid grasp of web3.

Some companies require a degree as a prerequisite. On the other hand, if you have measurable skills, it’s worth submitting an application documenting your real-world experience.

Web3 technical recruiters can strategise their demanding workload and identify the best networks to find top talent. Most importantly, the best technical recruiters have a solid social media presence and can build successful business relationships.

### Why should I learn about web 3.0?

The web3 industry is expanding exponentially, and there’s probably never been a better time to learn more about it. With rising global unemployment, higher inflation and increasing costs, a career in web3 could be the best opportunity in this evolving digital economy.

### Is web3 the future of the Internet?

Web3 introduces enhanced end-user control and content ownership, cutting out the intermediaries. As a result, web3 social platforms may spring up in the future, and in addition, we could see the rise of new search engines and marketplaces with collective ownership.

Meanwhile, corporation-controlled streaming services could become a thing of the past. Platforms we take for granted, like Netflix, could become dinosaurs in the web3 world.

Of course, nobody knows the future of web 3.0, and these opinions are purely speculative.

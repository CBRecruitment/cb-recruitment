Recruiter vs hiring manager? What’s the difference? Moreover, do recruiters work with hiring managers?

Finding the best candidates for a job role is a top priority for most organisations. It’s expensive and time-consuming if you hire the wrong people and cannot retain employees. A streamlined hiring and onboarding process can significantly impact workplace culture and the bottom line.

When a new employee turns out to be an excellent choice, your best employee, a recruiter and a hiring manager may take credit for selecting the best applicant. Still, what happens when it all goes wrong, and you find the worst employee working at your company? Who takes responsibility for that situation? Is there a process of analysis and a target for improvement?

There’s no such thing as failure if it leads to improvement. After all, Thomas Edison “_failed_” 10,000 times before successfully inventing the lightbulb. Improving the recruiting process must be at the forefront of hiring decisions, constantly focusing on selecting the right people and formulating a tried and trusted hiring procedure.

Hiring manager vs recruiter? The fundamental choice is about whoever does the better job consistently bringing in top talent.

Hiring and retaining employees goes way beyond a successful interview but is that the job of a hiring manager or recruiter? Are they responsible for workplace culture, poor working conditions, or domineering management? The point is, assigning blame to the hiring process is not strictly beneficial. However, it’s the point where this post begins.

This guide to recruiter vs hiring manager unfolds the difference between a recruiter and a hiring manager. Moreover, you will discover what responsibilities each has and explore how to become a recruiter or a hiring manager.

## What’s the Difference Detween a Hiring manager and a Recruiter?

A hiring manager is a person who interviews a candidate and makes an offer of employment. A hiring manager or hiring team sets the criteria for job applications, filters through  [resumes](https://cbrecruitment.com/resume-with-no-experience/), and contacts suitable candidates for a first interview, which may be a  [phone interview.](https://cbrecruitment.com/phone-interview-tips/)

Hiring managers are usually team leaders and could be a direct supervisor to the newly employed candidate. They may help onboard and integrate a new employee into a team and introduce workplace practices and guidelines. A hiring manager may work with an external recruiter or alone to find candidates.

A recruiter is someone, an individual or company, that works as a hiring partner to help a hiring manager find and qualify suitable applicants. For instance, if a job role attracted 200 applications, the recruiter would filter resumes, choose the best candidates, and engage with them to further qualify their suitability for the position. After that, the recruiter presents the selected candidates to the hiring manager. Recruiters often help hiring managers prepare job descriptions and specifications.

The next step is to understand the differences between a recruiter vs hiring manager, so first, let’s look at the role of a hiring manager.

## What is a Hiring Manager?

Hiring managers are typically departmental team leaders or managers. It may not be a specific job role but an essential part of a manager’s role. For instance, suppose a team leader works on blockchain projects with a team including  [blockchain engineers](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-become-a-blockchain-engineer/), architects, and developers.

When a position opens for a new  [blockchain developer](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/), the team leader assumes the role of a hiring manager. This person knows the job role inside out, understands the project’s demands, and is, therefore, the perfect person for the hiring manager’s role. After the new blockchain developer joins the team, the hiring manager returns to the team leader position.

Some organisations may have a specific hiring manager role, but the hiring manager must comprehensively understand the job requirements in a complex environment such as blockchain.

## What Does a Hiring Manager Do?

The role of a hiring manager depends on several factors, including whether they work with a hiring team, alone or with a recruiter, but typical duties include: –

- **Identifying vacant positions in the company:**  Hiring managers identify immediate or future vacancies so they can plan job advertisements early
- **Collaboration:**  A hiring manager may work with the HR department, a hiring team, employees, or a recruiter
- **Create job posts:**  Hiring managers generally write the job descriptions and specifications to advertise or share with a recruiter, who will then post the vacancy on their website
- **Review candidate resumes:**  If a vacancy attracts a lot of applications, some hiring managers use Applicant Tracking Software to filter candidates through the qualification process. Others may manually review resumes
- **Interview candidates:**  Some hiring managers screen suitable candidates with a phone interview. Others may do face-to-face or video interviews. After that, a hiring manager may negotiate salary packages and arrange start dates and contracts
- **Assist with onboarding**: Hiring managers may assist with initial onboarding, introductions to teams and organise training. After that, they may hand over the ongoing process to a trusted employee on the team

## How Do you Become a Hiring Manager?

Becoming a hiring manager is a straightforward process if you are already working in a management or leadership role within a team or department. You’ll need a comprehensive understanding of the recruiting and hiring process and best practices. It’s a responsible and enjoyable role for the right person.

If you are beginning your career and have no leadership or management experience, consider the following strategies for becoming a hiring manager: –

### Look for Intern Opportunities

Starting at the bottom is tough, but an internship is an excellent foundation for developing core skills and expanding your professional network. Seek industries that you enjoy and demonstrate a passion for the space to a potential employer. Agree on targets for learning outcomes and discuss the potential for a job offer if you show a good aptitude and fit in with the organisation.

### Get Work Experience

One of the age-old annoyances for job applicants is not getting a job because they don’t have enough experience. However, there are plenty of  [entry-level cryptocurrency jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/entry-level-cryptocurrency-jobs-with-no-experience/)  available. Organisations are always looking for talented individuals to add to their workforce. When interviewed, discuss the options for developing into a management and, later, hiring manager’s role.

### Strive for a Management Position

Not everyone is suitable for management roles, and inexperienced candidates often get confused about whether to become a leader vs boss. You must gain the necessary skills and experience to pursue a manager’s position.

Above all, your role involves managing a team of people, which is not an easy task. Get as much management training as possible before requesting a promotion to management.

### Gain Certification

Gaining certification can give you a competitive edge over other applicants.  [The Society for Human Resources Management](https://www.shrm.org/)  is a reputable organisation that offers certification in human resources and related roles.

So, that’s the outline of a hiring manager role. In the recruiter vs hiring manager debate, only you can decide which would suit you best. Since becoming a hiring manager depends on management or leadership skills, it could take a while for you to gain that experience.

The following section focuses on the role of a recruiter, what skills are necessary and how you can become a recruiter.

## What is a Recruiter?

Recruiter vs hiring manager? What are the core differences?

Recruiters work daily to find the best candidates for an organisation. Some recruiters focus on filling specific vacancies. Others search for top talent with the skills and aptitude to benefit an organisation, regardless of whether there is an existing vacancy. Most recruiters tend to combine both roles because there is an increasing demand in the cryptocurrency industry for top-level candidates with specific skills and qualifications.

## What Does a Recruiter Do?

A recruiter’s daily duties are similar across a broad spectrum of industries and organisations: –

- **Create recruitment strategies:**  Each recruiter may have variable strategies depending on whether they work with a hiring manager or alone. Typically, the first step is to identify and reach out to suitable candidates in their network or through the existing candidates on file
- **Job postings:**  Recruiters list job openings on their website and may also use external job posting sites
- **Review resumes:**  A recruiter’s role is to look for the best candidates and further screen applications by a first contact via phone or video meeting.
- **Collaborate with hiring managers:**  Once the recruiter is happy the candidate is perfect for a vacancy, the next step is to discuss with the hiring manager and send the candidate’s resume for assessment
- **Collaborate with candidates:**  The professional recruiter can help prepare candidate resumes and cover letters. They may assist with the interview process by advising on best practices and sharing tips. In addition, the recruiter can keep candidates in the loop with feedback from hiring managers

## How Do You Become a Recruiter?

You either love recruiting or loathe it, as there’s no middle ground. The job of a recruiter is challenging, juggling many roles, and keeping hiring managers and candidates happy. Moreover, the successful recruiter needs a constant stream of excellent candidates to present to hiring managers. It’s a demanding and high-pressure role. It’s easy to reach burnout if you are unprepared for the challenges.

However, if you love the recruiting process, there’s nothing more rewarding than matching a candidate with a hiring manager and leading to employment. The job combines sales and negotiation skills, excellent communication, an understanding of human psychology and the uncanny knack for spotting the high-performing  _dark horse_  among a sea of applicants.

The following skills reflect many prerequisites for recruitment roles: –

### Achieve a Degree

Do you need a degree to be a high-functioning recruiter? Maybe not, but many recruiters have a bachelor’s degree that majors in human resources, marketing, psychology, or sociology. Having a degree can help get your foot through the first door. However, some of the best recruiters make up for the lack of a degree with exceptional aptitude and natural flair for the recruiting process.

### Develop the Skills Required for Recruiting

A recruiter’s role is a unique combination of skills. It’s fair to say that without these skills, getting a job as a recruiter will be near impossible: –

- Excellent communication
- Critical thinking
- Time management
- Good strategist
- Active listening
- Sales driven
- Problem-solving
- Computer skills
- Organised
- Confident

The above skills must be measurable and verifiable.

### Gain Relevant Work Experience

If you have zero experience in recruiting, you may wish to gain experience in an environment where you can acquire the skills. For instance, a sales background helps demonstrate many of the skills required for recruiting. You could also consider human resources, operations, or the administration department.

### Recruitment Certification

Gaining a recruitment qualification shows a company you are serious about the role of a recruiter. There are many online reputable recruitment training courses such as  [Social Talent](https://www.socialtalent.com/recruiting-training?creative=537483868551&keyword=%2Brecruiter%20%2Btraining&matchtype=b&network=g&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7KqZBhCBARIsAI-fTKLICvmbEz4pYonlgD1PuNI8fHC3MfivIMFZ7W-W0EH_y86pwh0g0MIaAkUwEALw_wcB)  that have trained 100k plus recruiters, and  [Barclay Jones](https://www.barclayjones.com/recruiter-training/recruiter-training-courses?source=google.com)  [Recruitment HIIT](https://www.barclayjones.com/recruiter-training/recruiter-training-courses?source=google.com)  training course.

## FAQs

### Should I contact hiring manager or recruiter?

It depends on how you found out about a job vacancy. If the recruiter advertised the job, that person is your point of contact. If a hiring manager invites applications through their website or a job posting board, that person is the one to contact with any queries about the vacancy.

## Should I go around recruiter to hiring manager?

Always maintain honesty and integrity when applying for any position, whether with a recruiter or hiring manager. If you bypass a recruiter, your actions could negatively impact your application.

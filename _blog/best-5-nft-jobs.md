## What are NFTs?

NFT is an abbreviation for non-fungible tokens. Fungible means one thing is exchangeable for another. For instance, you can exchange one dollar for a dollar and one Bitcoin for another. NFTs are unique. You cannot change one like-for-like, hence the term “_non-fungible_“.

NFT artists may create an NFT to sell on an NFT art website, and today some of the top NFT projects have many NFT collectables selling for crazy high prices. Subsequently, you may want to become an NFT creator and make money from NFT trading cards or NFT farming. As a result of increasing interest, many popular NFT tokens are on NFT channels.

However, NFT investing is risky, and even the price of the top 10 NFT tokens falls in value during a cryptocurrency bear market. Subsequently, instead of seeking the best NFT to invest in, you’d likely do better learning how to apply for NFT jobs and work your way into an NFT company.

## What Are NFT Jobs?

NFT projects require a team of staff to help manage the project. As a project grows, it may become more complex and demanding, requiring various employee skills. The foundational NFT jobs are  [blockchain developers](https://cbrecruitment.com/become-a-highly-paid-blockchain-developer/),  [blockchain architects](https://cbrecruitment.com/blockchain-architect/)  and blockchain engineers. Additionally, projects require product and project managers to help oversee the project.

As the development team rolls out a project, the goal is to develop a loyal community. The marketing and social media management teams focus on attracting and nurturing a community by building trust and interest in the project.

In addition, the project may think it has the best NFT token, but without an audience, the project will fail. For instance, the NFT  [Crypto punk](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)  gained massive popularity from skilful marketing and social media efforts.

## FAQs

### Can NFT jobs be full-time?

### Will I be paid in crypto working for NFT companies?

You may receive payment for your work with NFT in crypto, but all companies differ. As cryptocurrencies are so volatile, most companies don’t have their entire treasury in cryptocurrency. The best thing to do is ask the hiring manager about payment options during the interview.

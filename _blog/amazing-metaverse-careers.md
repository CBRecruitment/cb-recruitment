## What is the Metaverse?

Not to be confused with a pure gaming experience, in a nutshell, the metaverse is a combination of technologies where users can experience real-world activities and processes. For instance, you can buy and sell virtual land and real estate, set up commercial businesses, and attend music concerts, conferences, parties, games, and meetings. You can purchase physical and virtual items like clothes and sneakers from companies inside the metaverse and create an avatar to represent you in the space.

In short, the metaverse is a virtual representation of the real world but kind of better, some might say.

## What is the Future of the Metaverse?

According to a  [share and trends analysis report](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5561852/metaverse-market-size-share-and-trends-analysis), the global metaverse market size will reach $678 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 39.4% from 2022 to 2030. This forecast mainly focuses on the widespread adoption and increased demand from end-use industries.

At a time when many industries are struggling financially, the metaverse certainly appears not to be slowing down any time soon, and that can only be good if you plan to pursue a metaverse career.

**Metaverse growth will spread across multiple global industries, such as: –**

1. Defence
2. Education
3. Media
4. Aerospace
5. Entertainment

The point is, there’s probably never been a better time to start thinking about  [metaverse jobs](https://cbrecruitment.com/metaverse-jobs/). We see an increase in demand for top talent, and  [metaverse companies](https://cbrecruitment.com/metaverse-companies-opportunities/)  typically pay well for the best candidates.

Of course, it’s an opinion; feel free to dispute it. Still, with innovation and growth comes opportunity. That’s a fact.

So, without further ado, let’s explore the five metaverse careers that could change your life.

To secure a metaverse job as a storyteller, you must demonstrate creative writing and storytelling skills. Some organisations may list a degree as a prerequisite.

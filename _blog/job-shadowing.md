What is job shadowing?

## Preparing for a Work Shadowing Experience

Firstly, ask for an agenda, as correct preparation enables you to gain the most benefits from job shadowing.

Secondly, prepare a list of exploratory questions based on what you know and what you would like to learn.

**Questions to Ask When Job Shadowing: –**

- What qualifications and skills are essential for your role?
- What are the most enjoyable aspects of your job?
- Are there any challenges in this role? If so, what are they?
- How can you progress in this field?
- Can you work remotely?
- Are flexible hours available for your job?
- Can you recommend any courses, books, videos or websites I can visit to learn more?
- Would you do anything differently if you started again?

### How to Make the Most of Your Job Shadowing Experience

Job shadowing opportunities are an excellent way to advance your career. Therefore, making the most of your time with a mentor is vital. Be proactive, ask questions (ideally starting with the prewritten questions) and take copious notes. You may think you will remember everything, but storing new information is challenging if there’s a lot of it.

**Tip #1:**  Ideally, if you are joining the workplace as an external candidate, choose an organisation with a healthy work environment. Job shadowing in a  [toxic work environment](https://cbrecruitment.com/how-to-deal-with-a-toxic-work-environment/)  is unlikely to be a pleasant experience.

**Tip #2:**  Get involved. Ask your mentor for hands-on experience and request feedback. Tell your mentor that you are open to criticism because you are keen to learn and take responsibility for tasks.

**Tip #3:**  Always be professional. Show respect and consideration towards your mentor, and be polite, even if the mentor does not have good communication skills.

**Tip #4:**  Be fearless. Take this opportunity to get out of your comfort zone because accepting new challenges will help with personal and professional development.

**Tip #5:**  Afterwards, send a thank you note to your mentor, expressing gratitude for sharing their time, knowledge and expertise. Ask if you can come back to them if you have more questions.

## Planning an Organisational Job Shadowing Strategy

Adding a work shadowing strategy into the workplace can add exceptional value, and it needn’t be expensive to set up.

Firstly, decide upon the reason for a mentoring program. Secondly, calculate the cost of taking an employee away from their regular job.

If you’re running an in-house job shadowing program, figure out what incentives will encourage employees to participate. The program should enrich the employee experience, enabling them to learn new competencies to enhance their career. It can also help  [increase engagement and retention rates](https://cbrecruitment.com/employee-retention-strategies/).

For the mentors, seek employees who actively want more responsibility, perhaps those wishing to transition into leadership roles.

Finally, track all efforts and outcomes of the work shadowing program to assess the efficacy of it becoming a long-term strategy.

2. Liaise with line managers and the shadow, detailing specifics such as core objectives and length of time and assigning the shadow’s current job tasks to another employee
3. Issue a request for review
4. Agree on specific timelines
5. Create an action plan, including job shadowing tasks
6. Implement the job shadowing
7. Track the job shadowing weekly
8. Provide feedback to the shadow, mentor, manager’s and stakeholders involved (if appropriate) and measure data based on outcome objectives

Job shadowing is a learning and development opportunity that can significantly increase job satisfaction by increasing engagement in the workplace.

## Are There Any Cons of a Work Shadowing Program?

Although job shadowing is an excellent strategy for employees, there can be some limitations to implementing it within the workplace: –

1. Reduced productivity: If staff are away from their primary job, it can cause a temporary dip in productivity. However, in time, the gains outweigh this minor issue
2. It can be tricky to organise: Navigating the logistics of aligning employee schedules can be problematic
3. Encouraging employees and managers to engage with the program can be tricky. To increase engagement, it’s essential to specify the benefits to the workforce
